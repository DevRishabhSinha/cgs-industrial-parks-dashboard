Pupuk Kujang's land holdings.\n\n(Bisnic.com, 8/13/2023, bandung.bisnis.com): Catalyst Factory Construction Progress at KIKC Entering the Completion Stage\n\"The progress of building a catalyst factory made by the nation's children located in the Kujang Cikampek Industrial Area (KIKC) is starting to enter the final stage. The construction of this factory was initiated by PT Katalis Sinergi Indonesia (KSI). PT KSI itself is a real manifestation of synergy between state-owned companies, educational institutions and scientists. This company is a consortium, namely between PT Pupuk Kujang which has joined with PT Research and Technology Center (RTC) and the Catalysis Engineering Center of the Bandung Institute of Technology (ITB). \"Currently, construction of the Catalyst factory is in the completion stage,\" said VP of Corporate Communications M Arief Rachman in his statement, Friday (18/8/2023). As is known, he said, the company will later focus on producing catalysts to make green fuel or environmentally friendly fuel. As for Pupuk Kujang Cikampek itself, as a petrochemical company, it also contributed to this.\nArief said that a catalyst is a substance that can speed up and direct chemical reactions when converting a raw material into another desired material.  \"A catalyst is very necessary to speed up the reaction in the process of converting palm oil or castor oil into biofuel (BBN),\" he said.\nIn the future, this biofuel is projected to be widely used. This is because fossil fuel oil will increasingly run out because it cannot be renewed. With catalysts, Indonesia can reduce the use of fossil fuels in everyday life. In the transportation sector, the use of fossil-based fuels is slowly being shifted and shifted to electrical energy and biofuels (BBN). To make BBN, a number of technologies are prepared including important materials such as catalysts.   \"So far, the use of catalysts in Indonesia still depends on imports. KSI products can later be used as import substitutes which will save the country's foreign exchange,\" said Arief. At ITB, one example of a product is a catalyst for converting palm oil into vegetable diesel (green diesel) or vegetable gasoline (green gasoline/bio gasoline) and which converts palm kernel oil into vegetable avtur (green avtur/bio avtur) all three of which are in the form of extrudates . The plan is that PT Katalis Sinergi Indonesia will produce a hydrotreating catalyst as an important ingredient in making biofuel which converts palm oil into diesel oil (D100). Apart from that, PT KSI can also make oleochemical catalysts for various industries. Meanwhile, some time ago the President Director of PT KSI Achmad Setiawan explained that this catalyst factory has a production capacity of 800 tons per year. This company is projected to be able to make 7 types of catalyst products. Namely 4 types of hydrotreating catalysts and 3 types of oleochemical catalysts.  This production is expected to be able to meet domestic catalyst needs. As a result, dependence on imported catalysts could be eroded. So, Indonesia does not need to import almost all of its catalyst needs. \"By establishing this factory, we are striving for independence so that we are not dependent on foreign nations. We are proving that Indonesia is capable of making its own catalyst,\" said Achmad some time ago. According to Achmad, the construction of this catalyst factory opens up opportunities for Indonesia to become independent in process technology and industrial resilience. The factory stands on 2 hectares of land at KIKC. (K60)\"\n\n(Pupuk Kujang, 2023, pupuk-kujang.co.id): Subsidiaries & Affiliates\n\"...5.

Designated a Technology and Manufacturing Special Economic Zone in June 2021.\n\n(Bisnis, 11/11/2023, ekonomi.bisnis.com): JIIPE Gresik Special Economic Zone Attracts Investment of IDR 52 Trillion\nJava Integrated Industrial and Ports Estate ( JIIPE ) has brought in investment worth IDR 52 trillion since it was designated as a Special Economic Zone (KEK) in Gresik, East Java. The Gresik SEZ, which is a national strategic project (PSN), in which there are two entities, namely PT BKMS as the developer and manager of the industrial area (development and management business entity) is a joint venture between PT Pelindo (Persero) and PT AKR Corporindo Tbk. with an ownership composition of 40% and 60%. Another entity is PT BMS as the manager of the port area (port business entity) with a composition of 60% and 40%.  Before October 1 2021, when four port management companies merged to become PT Pelindo (Persero), the two companies were affiliates of PT Pelindo III, while residential areas were developed and managed directly by PT AKR Surabaya Land Corporindo.\nPT BKMS Director of HR and Logistics Agung P. Guritno said that the government is targeting foreign investment in JIIPE to reach US$16 billion or around Rp. 250 trillion. \"So far, since it was designated as a KEK, investment entering JIIPE has reached around IDR 52 trillion and will continue to increase along with regional development,\" he explained in a press release, Friday (10/11/2023).\nAgung is optimistic that the targets set by the government will be met because of the various facilities provided by the government and industrial areas, especially connectivity between areas around Gresik and with the port. Achieving the target begins with the inclusion of mining product processing facilities or known as smelters owned by PT Freeport Indonesia, which is one of the leading industries in JIIPE. As part of the government's industrial downstream program, Freeport became JIIPE's anchor tenant with an area of ​​100 hectares.  As of the end of August 2023, the directors of PT Freeport Indonesia told the media that construction of the factory had reached 76%. Freeport is rushing to fulfill President Joko Widodo's request that this factory be operational by May 2024. The Freeport smelter factory, which was built with an investment of US$ 3 billion, is one of 21 companies that have joined JIIPE. Since JIIPE was confirmed as a special economic zone, five large tenants have joined and it is hoped that this will stimulate further interest from foreign investors to invest in the Gresik KEK. Built in 2012, the JIIPE Industrial Area was officially designated as a KEK through Government Regulation (PP) No. 71 of 2021 dated 28 June 2021 concerning the Gresik Special Economic Zone, with business activities consisting of production and processing; logistics and distribution; research, digital economy, technology development; and energy development supported by industry 4.0. This area, with a total area of ​​3,000 hectares, consists of the development of an industrial area of ​​1,761 hectares and a port area of ​​406 hectares, where both areas are SEZs supported by a residential area of ​​800 hectares.

Guritno, at the end of last October. The district and provincial governments have completed part of the widening of the provincial road which is one of the access points to JIIPE. \"Only access to the Bunder-Manyar Toll Road is still in the completion stage,\" added Agung. Later, this 9.39 kilometer long project will have direct toll gate access from JIIPE. Not only road access and various infrastructure such as water, gas and electricity networks that have been and are being built at JIIPE.

Copper will play a pivotal role in the EV ecosystem,” Tony said.\nThe $3 billion Manyar Smelter is expected to process 1.7 million tons of copper concentrates a year. Freeport’s existing smelter PT Smelting has an annual capacity of a million tons of copper concentrates.

Meanwhile, KITW has a special status because it holds the status of a National Strategic Project (PSN) in accordance with Presidential Regulation (Perpres) 58 of 2017, so that processing regional permits can be made easier.  Wilmar Project and Technical Director Erik Tjia said that investment growth had indeed slowed down due to the pandemic, but it was predicted that it would soon increase after the economy recovered. He is optimistic that the growing economy will have a positive impact on industrial area businesses.  \"We hope that the value of incoming investment will continue to increase,\" said Erik Tjia in a press conference at KITW, Serang, Banten, Friday (28/10/2022).  \nKITW Serang has made a positive contribution to the region through paying regional taxes, absorbing 70 percent-80 percent of the workforce from local communities, and other multiplier-effects . Erik explained that of the total land reserved for the development of KITW covering an area of ​​800 ha, 200 ha had been utilized for Wilmar's interests, in the form of building factories for cooking oil, rice, margarine, biodiesel, flour, jetties, packaging and employee housing. \nApart from Wilmar, several investors have entered the area, such as Perusahaan Gas Negara (PGN) and PT Baja Putra Deli.  Erik hopes that with KITW's status as a PSN, it will be easier to obtain permits and support from the central and regional governments to accelerate investment growth.  \"Investment is one of the pillars of economic growth,\" said Erik.  According to the Business Unit Head of PT Multimas Nabati Asahan Serang, Wilmar Tenang Sembiring group, as an industrial area, KITW is equipped with various facilities, such as asphalt roads that have access to toll roads, gas supplies of up to 20 million standard cubic feet per day (million standard cubic feet per day / MMSCFD), electricity supply up to 500 mega watts (MW), water, fiber optics, hydrant systems, waste processing ( incineration plant ), waste water treatment ( water treatment ), public facilities, and railways.  \"We plan to continue developing this area,\" he said Even though it has very adequate facilities, Wilmar still has difficulties regarding vehicle access, especially trucks, from the toll road to the KITW area because there is no direct access. Currently, transport trucks have to pass through small roads and even residential areas to reach KITW.  Tenang further said that another double effect was the absorption of workers, which currently at KITW has reached around 2,000 people, including construction workers.  Erik and Tenang hope that Wilmar's presence at KITW can supply food needs for Indonesia, especially Jabodetabek.\"", "Latitude": -6.004518, "Longitude": 106.088072, "Sources": "https://kppip.go.id/proyek-strategis-nasional/s-pembangunan-kawasan-industri-prioritas-kawasan-ekonomi-khusus/kawasan-industri-wilmar-serang/\nhttps://seputarcibubur.pikiran-rakyat.com/ekonomi-bisnis/pr-1785758260/wilmar-kembangkan-kawasan-industri-terpadu-di-serang-banten\nhttps://ekonomi.bisnis.com/read/20221028/47/1592615/jadi-psn-wilmar-investasi-rp152-triliun-di-kawasan-industri-serang\n(Archived link, 11/27/23) https://web.archive.org/web/20231127172956/https://kemenperin.go.id/kawasan\nhttp://kawasanindustriterpaduwilmarserang.co.id/tentang-kami/\nhttps://banten.antaranews.com/berita/171238/pln-rampungkan-proyek-gardu-induk-untuk-kawasan-industri-terpadu-wilmar\nhttps://www.antaranews.com/berita/3209093/kawasan-industri-terpadu-wilmar-siap-tarik-investor" }, "geometry": { "type": "Point", "coordinates": [ 106.088072, -6.004518 ] } },

If it rains, the road conditions are flooded and slippery.\nEven though it is not suitable, the road is still used because it is the only access.\n\"No one of my fellow workers complained, they're already used to it. When we pass, we take the road that goes this way (in the opposite direction), where the damage isn't too bad,\" added Ira.\nRoad users, who are factory workers, pass this road when they want to get to or from work.

This is in line with its commitment in the coordination meeting to resolve underground water use held by the Corruption Eradication Commission (KPK) together with the Ministry of Industry, North Sumatra Provincial Government (North Sumatra), Deli Serdang Regency Government, Medan City Government, and the KIM Company Association on March 17 2022 and November 23 2022. PT KIM President Director Daly Mulyana explained the progress of clean water infrastructure development and explained each progress, namely the first was the construction of the Water Treatment Plant (WTP) phase 2.\nOn October 19 2022, Daly said that KIM began construction of WTP phase 2 as a continuation of WTP phase 1 with a total available clean water capacity of 500,000 to 600,000 m3/month. \n\"On May 3 2023, a Commissioning Test was carried out to test the operational readiness of WTP Phase 2 and is targeted to be fully operational in June 2023. As part of the Build, Operate & Transfer cooperation package, WTP Phase 2 was built by PT Dain Celicani Cemerlang, as a partner PT KIM clean water cooperation, through PT KIM supervision,\" he said in a statement quoted on Thursday (8/6/2023). Then the second is the development and utilization of underground water. In line with the Corruption Eradication Commission's direction at the coordination meeting on November 23 2022 in efforts to stop the use of groundwater in the Medan Industrial Area as well as extraordinary steps by PT KIM to meet water needs, construction and utilization of groundwater was carried out by PT KIM. \nThis is in accordance with the letter from the Ministry of Industry Number B1284/KPAII.3/PWI/IV/2022 dated 14 April 2022 based on the Minister of Industry Regulation Number 40 of 2016 concerning Technical Guidelines for Industrial Area Development.  In its implementation, KIM is now synergizing with Danareksa Holding members, namely PT Jasa Tirta Luhur in building wells which will be utilized at 300,000 m3/month and distributed to tenants in the Medan Industrial Area.  \"The project began work on January 27 2023 with a contract value of IDR 22 billion and is targeted to operate in June 2023,\" he continued. The third is the collaboration between Perumda Tirtanadi. Daly explained that KIM synergized with Perumda Tirtanadi, which is the Regional Owned Enterprise (BUMD) of North Sumatra Province which serves industrial and household water needs in North Sumatra. \nHe also explained that Perumda Tirtanadi is committed to serving the needs of KIM Block 1 tenants amounting to 200,000 m3/month in June 2023. Lastly, construction of reservoirs and clean water distribution networks. Daly explained that KIM invested in the construction of a reservoir (storage tank) and clean water distribution pipe network in synergy with Danareksa Holding members.  \"As a state-owned company with experience in planning, PT KIM appointed PT Indra Karya to carry out the study and PT Nindya Karya as the contractor for the construction of reservoirs and clean water distribution networks with a volume of 300,000 m3/month with a pipe length of 5 km,\" continued Daly. Through this reservoir, he said again, clean water will be stored and distributed through a network of distribution pipes to all tenants according to their needs. With an investment of around IDR 65 billion, this project is targeted for completion in June 2023. As a subsidiary of BUMN and a member of Danareksa Holding, PT KIM invests in clean water infrastructure as a form of meeting the water needs of tenants in the area. \nIn line with the increase in water absorption by tenants, it is hoped that no tenants will use groundwater as is prohibited in Government Regulation Number 142 of 2015 concerning Industrial Areas.  In every investment budget preparation until its implementation, PT KIM applies the principles of prudence and Good Corporate Governance, namely referring to the regulations that apply within the BUMN environment and at Danareksa Holding as well as PT KIM's internal regulations.\"\n\n(Danareksa, 2023, danareksa.co.id): \"PT.

In the same year, the company invested to set up \"Indonesian Ketapang agricultural and forestry ecological industrial park co., LTD...\nLocated in lumber-and-land resource rich virgin forest, the program is positioned as based on planting, while making the most of its natural advantages to provide quality raw materials for wood and cassava products manufacturers.The project starts from the manufacturing industry (wood industry) ,expanding to the agricultural and forestry animal husbandry (quick growth forest, cassava, palm trees, fruit trees and other planting, agricultural and forestry product processing. Poultry farming, agricultural and forestry products research and development), and related manufacturing industries (paper making, palm oil, monosodium glutamate, feed, juice, freezing, etc.) logistics transportation industry, education, culture, tourism, etc.\nThe park has a planned area of five square kilometers and a total investment of about $800 million,which is divided into three phases of development and construction. The planned area of the first phase is 1 square kilometer from 2016 to 2019, the second phase 2 square kilometers from 2019 to 2022 while the third phase is 2 square kilometers from 2022 to 2025.\nThe first phase of the industrial park, with a total investment of $130 million dollars and a construction area of 1 square kilometer, is divided into two parts: infrastructure construction and housing construction with infrastructure construction mainly includes excavation of 12.5 km river channels, 13.8 km main road , 22.6km of open channel ditch,1 km embankment pier,10 bridges, 32808 square meters of square/stadium,8 power distribution rooms,1056 square meters of tap water/sewage treatment/waste treatment plants,20000 square meters of thermal power plant, 93581 square meters of wood, cassava yard as well as 300,000 square meters of greening.\nThe total 271760 square meters construction area is mainly used for 4346 square meters of commercial housing, 5033 square meters of hotel, 9821 square meters of staff dormitory, 6386 square meters of maintenance workshop, 5640 square meters of production auxiliary room,3545 square meters of office building and 236990 square meters of production premises.\nAt present, the construction of infrastructure and housing of the industrial park have been basically completed . About 70,000 square meters of factory buildings, 5,000 square meters of hotels and 30MW coal-fired power plants started construction in August ,2018 with the construction of the factory and hotel will be done in October 2019, and the power plant scheduled to start operation in February 2020 .\nBy August 2018, the first phase of the industrial park has been completed, and the factory and facilities have been put into use.\nThe industrial park began construction in 2016 and more than 20 enterprises will move in by 2019, covering varies fields including culture, education, scientific research, energy, auxiliary materials packaging, logistics and transportation,agricultural and forestry planting, breeding, cultivating, forest products processing, agricultural products and livestock products processing. By August 2018, there were already 14 enterprises setting up business in the park with an investment of about $200 million. In the future, 8 to 10 enterprises will start operating in the park, investing about $400 million dollars.\nThe core enterprise, BSM, undertook the installation and debugging of production equipment in 2017, and started trial operation in 2018, now having reached its production capacity. BSM expands its production line to pellet production,which is exported to Japan and South Korea, thus achieving 100% utilization of wood. Currently, the factory has 500 local employees and 30 Chinese technicians with plans to add 20 more Chinese managerial personnel and 1,000 more Indonesian employees.\nBased on the 196,000 hectares of virgin forest and planting woodland owned by the enterprises in the park and the 700,000 hectares of land resources jointly developed with the local government,the cluster area of the industrial park will extend to both ends of the wood products and cassava industry chain, ultimately encompassing trees/cassava breeding and planting, logs/cassava processing,wood products/starch products production, export sales,ancillary facility agricultural and forestry technology learning, energy power generation, bio-fuel, sewage waste treatment, logistics transportation, mechanical processing, auxiliary material production and other industries, and offering one-stop service including customs, commodity inspection, bank and commercial service, hotel, living facilities, personnel and finance.\nThrough integration of upstream and downstream industrial chain of agricultural and forestry products, the enterprises within the park aims for gradual expansion of improved seed cultivation, supply and large-scale planting, which will not only solve the problem of raw material supply, but also help to form a whole circular industrial chain of agricultural and forestry product research and development, seedling cultivation, agricultural and forestry planting, product production and export, thus ultimately improving the ability of overseas assets to resist risks. As a result of resource and labor cost advantages, when products are shipped back to China for sale, it reduces production cost for enterprises on the one hand and increases tax revenue for the country on the other hand.\nPhase two, phase three of the project will copy the first phase of the project model, at the same time continuing to expand the planting and manufacturing scale,introducing breeding enterprises, fertilizer factories, alcohol plants, sugar refineries, seedling breeding firms, agricultural machinery repair companies, agricultural technology training centers, etc. By 2025, when the five-square-kilometer industrial park is completed construction and fully put into operation, it is expected to generate $12 billion in sales and $1.5 billion in tax revenue for the Chinese government every year. In addition, the development of agroforestry eco-tourism will also be carried out to make Ketapang a featured demonstration city integrating agroforestry planting, ecological cultivation, agroforestry processing and ecological tourism.Based on the principle of protective use of natural resources, prioritizing environmental protection and rational utilization of ecological resources, facilitating trade, we strive to build a modern agricultural, forestry,ecological tourism industry clusters harmonizing agricultural, forestry and animal husbandry cultivation with agricultural, forestry and animal husbandry production base, seasonal scientific planting, agricultural and forest product processing and ecological tourism, making Ketapang industrial park a model project of \"One Belt And One Road\" agricultural and forestry cooperation between China and Indonesia.\"\n\n(Antara News, 10/11/2017, kalbar.antaranews.com): Ketapang Regent Invites People to Plant Sweet Potatoes\n\"Ketapang Regent Martin Rantan invited the community to promote cassava planting as a step to improve the economy in the area.\n\"Land that is not yet productive can be used to plant cassava.

This step is because the company is considered no longer efficient to continue.\nThe dissolution of one of the listed subsidiaries with the stock code KRAS has received the blessing of the Minister of State-Owned Enterprises (BUMN) Erick Thohir.\nSilmy explained that before the liquidation was carried out, his party first looked for partners or business partners. Unfortunately, he did not explain further the link between the liquidation of MJIS and the management's efforts to find new business partners.\n\"Currently MJIS has received approval to be liquidated, but before this liquidation is executed, we are looking for partners,\" said Silmy in a Hearing Meeting (RDP) with Commission VI DPR RI, Monday, April 11.\nFor your information, MJIS is a joint venture between Krakatau Steel and PT Aneka Tambang Tbk (ANTM), Meratus Jaya Iron &. This company was founded on June 9, 2008. The company is engaged in the industry and steel products, trade and services related to steel.\nMJIS is located in South Kalimantan by utilizing local iron ore reserves. In 2012, the company operated one unit of an iron factory (rotary kiln) from the planned two units, with a total capacity of 315,000 tons of direct reduced iron (DRI) per year.\nThe rotary kiln unit produces sponge iron which is processed from local iron ore. Meanwhile, the power plant has produced electricity using gas fuel from the rotary kiln factory unit. When it reaches full capacity, the electricity produced is 18 MW. In collaboration with PLN, this excess electricity will be distributed to the surrounding communities and small industries.\nHowever, MJIS experienced problems in its operation, in the form of limited infrastructure and delays in delivery of goods, installation and assembling of equipment. Because there was a commitment from the contractor PT Krakatau Engineering and shareholders, ANTM and KRAS were finally able to overcome these obstacles.\n\"But this can't be used because it's already inefficient and the location is far from further production,\" he said.\nQuoted from the Meratus Jaya website, this company has been operating since 2008 and has stopped operating due to falling iron ore prices on the world market. Thus, the selling price is not competitive.\nThis company has also been in production for approximately 3 years and has made the first shipment of sponge iron products of 5,000 metric tons to Krakatau Steel.\n\"Krakatau Steel itself, we no longer use sponge iron,\" he said.\"\n\n(Mariono, 9/6/2022, kalsel.antaranews.com): \"'Regarding KI Batulicin, it consists of block one and block two.

With the unveiling, other types of factories will follow.\nH Andi Syamsudin Arsyad, owner of, PT Jhonlin Group on December 17, 2021, said: \"in the future, we will build smelters or nickel smelters.\"\nEntrepreneur H Isam explained that the presence of SEZs in Tanah Bumbu is expected to absorb more than 10, 000 local workers and promote economic development in Tanah Bumbu and South Kalimantan. If nothing happens, the nickel smelter is scheduled to start research and construction in April 2022, with four production lines expected. Jhonlin Group will invest at least about $440 million. The nickel smelter will be the first and only Tanah Bumbu Regency in South Kalimantan.\nThe processing results of the Batulicin smelter will be shipped abroad in the form of semi-finished products and become finished products in the form of battery materials. The products of the smelter are then satisfied with domestic demand, as well as countries with other potential markets in the world. In response to the plan to build a smelter, Zairullah Azhar HM, Regent of Tanbu, continues to provide support.\"\n\n(Trihusodo, 11/1/2021, Indonesia.go.id): Bright Industrial Prospects in Batulicin\n\"A biodiesel plant operates in the Batulicin Industrial area. In the same place, the iron ore smelter is being revitalized. \"The government continues to push for an increase in biodiesel.\nIn the third week of August 2021, President Jokowi inaugurated a biodiesel factory in the Batulicin City industrial area, Tanah Bumbu Regency, South Kalimantan Province. The factory, which stands on an industrial area of ​​2,000 ha, is directly connected to the beach. The factory processes crude palm oil (CPO) into 1,500 tons of biodiesel per day, and was built with an investment of IDR 2 trillion.\nThe Batulicin biofuel industry is owned by Haji Isam, the popular name of businessman Syamsudin Andi Arsyad, who is known as the richest man and concurrently the coal king of South Kalimantan. ''I am willing to come here because this industry can open up great job opportunities,'' President Jokowi said in his remarks.\nSecond, he continued, the downstream industry can maintain the stability of palm oil prices, both in the domestic and international markets. Palm oil has a wider market. ''That way, the price can be more stable. Don't let our goods be owned, but the market will determine the price,'' said President Jokowi.\nPresident Jokowi also said that the Jhonlin Group's initiative to build a biodiesel factory was a downstream step for raw commodities that had to be encouraged. The head of state also hopes that PT Jhonlin and other business groups can conduct downstream activities more broadly. ''Either used as cooking oil, cosmetics, or other finished goods. I appreciate what PT Jhonlin Group has done, which certainly provides great added value,' said Jokowi...\nIndustrial area\nIn his report to President Jokowi, Commissioner of PT Jhonlin Agro Raya Andi Amran Sulaiman, (former Indonesian Minister of Agriculture 2014-2019), said that the biodiesel industry in Batulicin, with all its supporting industries upstream, can absorb up to 20,000 workers. There are thousands of others who are indirectly related to the industrial business.\nIt is also believed that the biodiesel industry will revive the prestige of the dim Batulicin Industrial Area. The industrial area itself is part of the PT Jhonlin Group business. According to Amran, the smelter will operate again in the area which will process iron sand (iron rock) into iron billets for the steel industry. The raw material for iron sand and iron stone itself is quite a lot in South Kalimantan, especially on Derawan Island, Sebuku Island, besides there are many others available in Central Sulawesi.\nThe smelter industry Amran Sulaiman refers to belongs to PT Meratus Jaya Iron and Steel (MJIS), a joint venture between two BUMNs, namely PT Krakatau Steel (Persero) Tbk and PT Aneka Tambang Tbk . The smelter operated for several years before closing in 2015 due to falling steel prices on the market. Occupying an area of ​​120 ha in Batulicin, the smelter owned by PT Meratus Jaya is currently being revitalized and is expected to return to production in 2023.\nThe Batulicin Industrial Area is one of 120 industrial areas in Indonesia, and the only one in South Kalimantan. It is not surprising that the South Kalimantan Provincial Government and Tanah Bumbu Regency Government have encouraged the industrial area to continue to develop.\nCurrently, Kotabaru Port in Batulicin has entered the sea highway network, and is one of 33 ports in the sea highway network equipped with Inaportnet 4.0 infrastructure. Kotabaru Port has also been equipped with warehouses, passenger terminals, container terminals, and can serve ships with large tonnages. Bersujud Airport in Batulicin City also has a runway that is 1,850 meters long, only an additional 100-200 meters is needed for Boeing 737s to land on it.\nHowever, compared to those standing in East Kalimantan, the Batulicin Industrial Area is still quiet. Apart from the biodiesel factory, cooking oil factory and iron ore smelter which are currently being restored using the latest technology, the Batulicin Industrial Area is only inhabited by a handful of medium-scale factories. PT Jhonlin Group, for example, also operates a rubber and wood pellet processing industry, from wood industry waste, which is used as fuel for heating stoves in four-season homes. The wood pellets are exported to Europe.\nThere are still many industries that can be accommodated. The need for clean water for industry is easy to obtain. Electricity supply is also available in sufficient quantities, available from the Barito power grid, with the back pole of the Bengkanai PLTG in Central Kalimantan.\nPresident Jokowi also reminded the importance of upholding the commitment to abandon fossil energy and switch to new, renewable energy. Therefore, the President encouraged biodiesel production to continue to be increased. Andi Amran Sulaiman, as the Main Commissioner of PT Jhonlin Agro Raya, has invited industry players to enter Batulicin.\nThe biodiesel industry itself will continue to develop in the country. 'In 2021, our target is to be able to produce and distribute 9.2 million kiloliters, and I hope that next year it can increase even higher,\" said President Jokowi. PT Jhonlin's biodiesel factory may be facing a fairly bright business situation.\"", "Latitude": -3.284766552, "Longitude": 116.0656929, "Sources": "https://indonesia.go.id/kategori/editorial/3432/prospek-cerah-industri-di-atas-batulicin\nhttps://www.researchgate.net/publication/338592175_Permasalahan_Pertanahan_Kawasan_Industri_Batulicin_Perspektif_Perencanaan_Pembangunan\nhttps://kalsel.antaranews.com/berita/341569/pemda-aceh-tertarik-pengelolaan-kawasan-industri-batulicin\nhttps://kppip.go.id/en/national-strategic-projects/s-priority-industry-zone-development-special-economic-zone/batulicin-industrial-zone-south-kalimantan/ \nhttps://indonesia.go.id/kategori/editorial/3432/prospek-cerah-industri-di-atas-batulicin\n(Archived link, 11/27/23) https://web.archive.org/web/20231127172956/https://kemenperin.go.id/kawasan\nhttps://voi.id/en/economy/156383 \nhttps://kalsel.antaranews.com/berita/397269/pemkab-tanah-bumbu-optimalkan-potensi-kek-setangga\nhttps://news.metal.com/newscontent/101702125/construction-of-the-south-kalimantan-nickel-smelter-will-begin-in-april-2022\nhttps://swa.co.id/swa/business-strategy/investasi-anugerah-barokah-bangun-smelter-nikel-rp6-triliun-dan-serap-1-200-pekerja\nhttps://www.kanalkalimantan.com/tambahan-3-kapasitor-75-mvar-di-batulicin-pln-perkuat-keandalan-listrik-layani-industri/\nhttps://banjarmasin.apahabar.com/post/jhonlin-group-dukung-pembangunan-sutt-150-kv-batulicin-tarjun-l7cr4686" }, "geometry": { "type": "Point", "coordinates": [ 116.0656929, -3.284766552 ] } },

The $2bn project is expected to consume at least 6mn t/yr of coal to produce 1.8mn t/yr of methanol once operational, Bumi said.\nThe new gasification facility will be built at the Batuta Chemical Industrial Park (BCIP) located in Bengalon, east Kalimantan, Bumi added. The area is currently undergoing the second stage of land clearing in preparation for actual construction of the plant to begin. The facility is targeted for completion by late 2025 or early 2026.\nUnder an initial agreement by both companies, Bumi will supply coal for the facility through its Kaltim Prima Coal (KPC) mining subsidiary and its Ithaca Resources' Kaltim Nusantara Coal subsidiary. Both companies will be responsible for the offtake of the methanol produced, while Air Products will be the builder, owner, and operator of the facility.\nIndonesia's energy ministry (ESDM) welcomed the development of the new gasification facility, saying that these types of projects will help accelerate investments in the growing downstream coal sector.\nInvestments remain low because of the significant financial undertaking needed, as well as the lack of an existing market for coal derivative products, the ESDM said. The ESDM is hoping that the commercial operations of two large-scale coal gasification plants will demonstrate the economic feasibility of the downstream coal sector to industry players.\nThe methanol produced by the plant is expected to help reduce imports, and increase the value of lower-quality coal produced in Indonesia.\"\n\n(Media Kaltim, 4/26/2022, mediakaltim.com): A coal-to-methanol processing plant will soon be built in Kutim\n\"The government has started the construction of a coal gasification industry into dimethyl ether (DME) in East Kutai.

Currently, the work is entering the land clearing stage at the Batuta Chemical Industrial Park (BCIP), Bengalon, East Kutai.\n\"We are currently in the second phase of the land clearing process. The construction has already been prepared,\" said Puguh when met at the Odah Etam Hall, Samarinda.\nFor information, the gasification project is being undertaken by PT Bakrie Capital Indonesia (BCI) and PT Ithaca Resources and Air Products from the United States. The project value is around USD 2 billion or IDR 30 trillion (exchange rate IDR 14,900/USD). If this project is completed, PT Bumi Resources TBK (BUMI) through its subsidiary, PT Kaltim Prima Coal, will become the supplier of the coal needs. The projected amount of coal is 6 million tons per year.\n\"This is included in the downstream strategy and increasing added value. God willing, we will control it,\" Puguh added.\nStill at the Odah Etam Hall, the East Kutai Regent, Ardiansyah, confirmed that the construction of a methanol processing plant is underway in his area. The project belongs to BCIP. Based on information received by Ardiansyah, the construction is targeted to be completed in 2024.

As a new profitable industrial park development, this project has three main success factors for the development strategy to establish a comprehensive industrial park. \nFirst, the development shall provide an integrated infrastructure network. Second, the development shall accommodate a self-sustained industrial estate development, and third, the development shall be planned to be the center of excellence in new coal processing.\nThe realization of these success factors requires the implementation of design principles that create a clear and functional development structure, flexible land parcels, green and blue infrastructure, and efficient phasing on the clustering.\nHalf of the approximately 943,8 hectares land area is designed to serve industrial programs. These programs are clustered based on coal processing and are part of Industrial Land, which will be sold out to investors. On the other hand, the Small Medium Enterprise (SME) area, which is part of the Industrial Building, will be rented out.\nTo enhance the feature as an integrated industrial park development, parts of the land area are also planned to support the industrial programs, such as commercial and public facilities, public amenities, potential transportation facilities (port), and a government office.

Supporting industries range from coal power plants, manganese, silicon, chrome, lime, coke and other factories, to ports and airports.\nIMIP Industrial Zone is a collaboration between BintangDelapan Group from Indonesia and Tsingshan Steel Group from China.\nTsingshan Group at a Glance\nBefore building a nickel-based industry in Morowali, Tsingshan Group had 3 nickel pig iron (NPI) production units with a capacity of 2 million tons and 3.4 million tons of Stainless Steel. Tsingshan Group is the largest company in the world in the field of nickel processing and has mastered complete processing technology with advanced and modern technology.\"\n\n(Ginting & Moore, 11/22/2021, thepeoplesmap.net):\n\"The Indonesia Morowali Industrial Park (IMIP) was initially built for the purpose of developing nickel pig iron and stainless-steel production, but with the rise of the electric vehicle market, the park’s focus expanded to take advantage of the emergence of nickel as a critical mineral in the renewable energy transition. Construction of the park, in Morowali Regency, Central Sulawesi, began in 2013, and it is now the largest nickel-based industrial area in Indonesia, with 11 smelters. However, this massive development has a significant ecological footprint through submarine wastewater disposal and air pollution from coal-generated power.\n[IMIP] Project Impacts:\nWater Pollution and Biodiversity Loss: Pollution and wastewater runoff from the park have impacted water quality, decreasing the numbers of fish and other marine life and forcing fishers to travel further out to sea. Proposed plans for deep-sea tailings disposal raised serious environmental concerns but applications were later withdrawn by the company.\nAir Pollution: Emissions from the plants powering the park are increasing air pollution and causing respiratory illnesses in surrounding populations.\nDeforestation: Rates of deforestation rose in the years following the Indonesian Government’s ban on resource exports and the start of construction of the IMIP in 2013.\nMilitarisation: The IMIP is designated a National Strategic Project (NSP), and to protect the investment, the police presence has already increased in the vicinity and an additional military presence is planned.\nLabour: Workers lack labour protections and face job instability, low wages, and workplace safety hazards.\nLocal Community: Despite the jobs created in the park, most local people remain engaged in agriculture as they do not have the skills or desire to work in industrial projects. A decline in government investment in agricultural projects, coupled with environmental impacts from the IMIP, has caused hardship for farmers.\"", "Latitude": -2.830375288, "Longitude": 122.1619121, "Sources": "https://ejatlas.org/conflict/indonesia-morowali-industrial-park-imip1\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morowali_Industrial_Park#cite_note-15\nhttps://www.gem.wiki/Sulawesi_Mining_power_station\nhttps://www.gem.wiki/Sulawesi_Labota_power_station\n(Broken) https://www.nickelmagazine.com/2022/04/smelter-industrial-area.html?m=1\nhttps://www.rosalux.de/fileadmin/images/publikationen/Studien/Fast_and_Furious_for_Future.pdf\nhttps://www.rosalux.de/en/publication/id/44155/fast-and-furious-for-future\nhttps://asiatimes.com/2023/01/chinas-labor-practices-under-hot-fire-in-indonesia/\nhttps://www.reuters.com/article/us-indonesia-nickel-environment-idUSKBN26N1VZ\nhttps://www.scmp.com/week-asia/people/article/3212109/indonesias-nickel-sector-under-scrutiny-chinese-workers-allege-inhumane-working-conditions\"\nhttps://thepeoplesmap.net/project/indonesia-morowali-industrial-park-imip/\nhttps://chinadialogue.net/en/energy/chinas-no-overseas-coal-power-pledge-15-projects-cancelled/\n(Archived link, 11/27/23) https://web.archive.org/web/20231127172956/https://kemenperin.go.id/kawasan\n(Archived link, 11/28/23) https://web.archive.org/web/20231128184118/https://business-indonesia.org/data-estate\n(Archived link, 5/29/24) https://web.archive.org/web/20240529165334/https://imip.co.id/\nhttps://www.reuters.com/article/china-gem-nickel-indonesia-idUKL1N3780PR/\nhttps://en.antaranews.com/news/285885/government-devising-development-plan-for-morowali-industrial-area\nhttps://industri.kontan.co.id/news/tak-lagi-tambah-tenant-ini-penjelasan-ceo-indonesia-morowali-industrial-park-imip\nhttps://indonesiabusinesspost.com/risks-opportunities/sesna-group-open-collaboration-to-develop-200-mw-solar-farm-for-nickel-mining-industry/\nhttps://www.energytransitionpartnership.org/uploads/2022/09/The-Electricity-Infrastructure-Planning-and-Investment-Needs-to-Support-Energy-Transition.pdf " }, "geometry": { "type": "Point", "coordinates": [ 122.1619121, -2.830375288 ] } },

Based on PT KIMA data, 30 percent of the shares are owned by the provincial government and 10 percent by the Makassar City Government.\"\n\n(Adrianople Group, 6/22/2022, adrianoplegroup.com): Zone Profile: Makassar Industrial Estate\n\"Zone Overview‍\nThe Makassar Industrial Estate is a Special Economic Zone (SEZ) located on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi.\nThe Makassar Industrial Estate is located right outside of the city of Makassar, which is the capital of the South Sulawesi province, and has a population of 1.5 million, making it the 13th largest city in the country. [1]\nThe estate is publicly owned and operated. Tenants include companies in the food processing and manufacturing industries. They enjoy various tax and regulatory incentives, as well as access to transportation infrastructure.\nHistory of the Zone\nIn 1988, the Indonesian government created the Makassar Industrial Estate.[2]\nThe estate was created at a time of rapid economic growth in Indonesia. President Suharto, who governed Indonesia from 1968 until 1998, made significant reforms to the economy. Indonesia’s GDP grew from $7 billion USD in 1968 to $84 billion USD in 1988.\nIn the late 1980s, the Indonesian government passed several reforms to increase exports such as devaluing the currency. Notably, in 1989, the government created SEZ-style “Industrial Estates.” Restrictions on foreign investment within the estates were relaxed. The reforms were successful.[5] The GDP per capita of Indonesia grew 550% during the 1990s, and annual GDP growth averaged at 7%.[6]\nPlans for the Makassar Industrial Estate go as far back as 1975, with the growth of the business park mostly occurring in the 1990s and early 2000s. The estate started producing cacao and flour in the early 2000s.[15]\nIn April 2019, the Makassar New Port opened several kilometers from the estate.[2] Recently there have been plans to expand zone because most of the existing plots have already been sold out.[4]\nNotable Tenants\nAs of 2020, there are 270 businesses operating within the industrial estate, 27 of which are Japanese companies.[2] The tenants belong to the following industries: seafood processing, cold storage, animal feed, and agricultural processing.[2]\nOne notable tenant is Indofood, one of Indonesia’s largest food processors. Another notable tenant is Plastindo, a large plastic packaging manufacturer.\nManagement of the Zone\n‍The Makassar Industrial Estate is managed by Kawasan Industri Makassar (KIMA).\nKIMA is a state owned enterprise which manages Makassar as well as several other industrial estates on the island of Sulawesi.[1] 60% of the company is owned by the Indonesian government, the Government of South Sulawesi owns 30% of the shares, and the remaining 10% is owned by the Makassar city government.[2] It is regulated by the Indonesian Ministry of State Owned Enterprises.[1]\nMain Incentives\n‍The laws that currently govern the Makassar Industrial estate are Law 39 from 2009 and Government Regulation 40 from 2021.[2][7][8][9]\nCompanies located in the zone can take advantage of the following incentives:\nThe ability to write off various investments from the corporate income tax\nAccelerated depreciation and amortization of assets\nA 10% tax on dividends\nStreamlined import / export regulations\nEasy access to business VISAs\n0% interest rates on loans for land purchases\nThe minimum wage for tenants has been reduced from 4.4 million IDR / month ($305) to 2.9 million IDR ($200)\nKIMA (the management company) will handle environmental impact assessments\n‍Infrastructure\n‍As of early 2020, the zone covers an area of 336 hectares, although there are plans for expansion.[2] The estate provides electricity, clean water, telecommunications, medical clinics, warehouses, and has a fire station. The estate also helps its tenants with construction by providing transportation or rental of equipment. The park is also the only industrial area in Sulawesi that has a liquid waste treatment process.[10]‍\nAs for location, the zone is 5 km away from the Sultan Hasanuddin International Airport, 18 km away from the Soekarno Hatta Seaport, 7.6 km away from the train station, and 1.8 km away from the main road.[2]\nCorporate Social Responsibilities\n‍The Makassar Industrial Estate’s management company, KIMA, has created various corporate social responsibility programs.[12] These include:\n-KIMA Green, a program that seeks to reduce air pollution by planting trees and reducing tenant emissions\n-Financing for local entrepreneurs\n-An Educational Assistance Program\n-​​A Free Rice ATM which gives ATM cards to the community that can be used to withdraw 5 liters of free rice every 2 weeks\nEffects of COVID-19\nFor the few months of the pandemic, the estate had difficulties importing raw materials for processing. The breakdown of the global supply chain caused many tenants to be starved for inputs.[14] Consequently, KIMA suffered financially. The park’s financial performance in 2020 dropped compared to their performanced in 2018. Net profit in 2020 had shrunk by 10% compared to the previous year.[13]\nPlanned Expansion\n‍In early 2019, the Ministry of Investment announced that they would expand the zone from 336 hectares to 1000 hectares. Existing plots were almost entirely sold out, and the estate found itself unable to accommodate new investors seeking to enter. A second location, called KIMA 2, is scheduled to be built elsewhere in the city Makassar.[11] The Makassar Industrial Estate is also working to modernize its logistics systems.\nConclusion\n‍The Makassar Industrial Estate is one of Indonesia’s fastest growing SEZs, and will likely continue playing a major role in the region over the next decade.\"  ", "Latitude": -5.104643, "Longitude": 119.497902, "Sources": "https://madeinindonesia.com/images/minisite/itpc_uae/MAKASSAR-MAROS%20INDUSTRIAL%20ESTATE.pdf\nhttps://www.adrianoplegroup.com/post/zone-profile-makassar-industrial-estate\nhttps://kedai-berita.com/2023/05/20/aph-diminta-usut-aroma-korupsi-pemanfaatan-anggaran-pengelolaan-limbah-di-kima/\n(Archived link, 11/27/23) https://web.archive.org/web/20231127172956/https://kemenperin.go.id/kawasan\nhttp://ptkimamakassar.co.id/\nhttps://sulawesi.bisnis.com/read/20231026/539/1708089/kawasan-industri-makassar-didorong-gaet-investor\nhttps://ptkimamakassar.co.id/profile/" }, "geometry": { "type": "Point", "coordinates": [ 119.497902, -5.104643 ] } },

Air Products' maneuver was also motivated by the US Government's policy of supporting the development of new and renewable energy (EBT) by providing subsidies to projects being carried out, especially hydrogen development.\n\"Because the US is encouraging the use of hydrogen, they feel that business in the US is more attractive. In the US there are subsidies for EBT, there are more interesting projects for hydrogen,\" said Arifin when met at the Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources office on Friday (17/3). This is regulated in the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) or the Inflation Reduction Act which was issued in August 2022. Through the IRA, the US government disbursed US$ 369 billion to maintain national energy security while reducing the impact of climate change. The IRA also arranges easy investment credit for the development of hydrogen storage projects and technologies. \"This is what causes many investors to flee to the US,\" said Arifin.\"\n\n(Arief, 11/28/2022, merdeka.com): \"President Director of PT Bukit Asam Tbk Arsal Ismail said his party is still waiting for a Presidential Regulation (Perpres) which is still in the drafting stage, for the coal gasification project to Dimethyl Ether (DME). This downstream project is targeted to be completed in 2027.\nThis project is handled by 3 companies, namely PTBA as a coal supplier, PT Pertamina as an offtaker, and a company from the United States Air Products as a processing and technology provider.\n\"Now, the most important point for us is the regulation. Until now, the draft presidential regulation has been discussed by the relevant ministries and this is one of the necessary conditions that we must fulfill so that this project can accelerate the DME,\" said Arsal in the Commission VII DPR RI Hearing Meeting with PTBA, Monday (28/11).\nThis Presidential Decree is one of the 6 points of coal gasification progress. In the first stage, his party has signed the Cooperation Agreement for the Coal to DME project. Currently, the process is awaiting signature from Pertamina Patra Niaga.\nThen, his party is also carrying out a site investigation by Air Product Company Indonesia (APCI) and discussing land cost side agreements. Currently, a geotechnical survey has been carried out at the Coal to DME project site.\n\"We have also done and are currently doing this and address readiness in the field. Of course, we and Air Products as a processing company are conducting an assessment of the technical specifications for land preparation at the Coal to DME project site. We are doing this in detail, because that is the location. the land generally contains coal,\" continued Arsal.\nIn terms of carrying out sampling and analysis of Banko Tengah A coal specifications, his party has drilled at 32 points until November 2022. With a target of completing drilling at 7 points by December 2022.\n\"We have also carried out coal sampling and analysis of coal specifications which we are focusing on in the Banko Tengah A block. We have and are doing this and we have done it. There have been 30 more drilling points, and there are 7 points we are hoping for. finished in December,\" he said.\"\n\n(CNBC Indonesia, 1/24/2022, cnbcindonesia.com): \"After a long wait, President Joko Widodo (Jokowi) has finally inaugurated a coal downstream project into Dimethyl Ether (DME) located in the Tanjung Enim Industrial Area, Muara Enim Regency, South Sumatra.\nDownstream coal itself has actually been mandated in Law (UU) No. 4/2009 concerning Mineral and Coal Mining. After almost 12 years of waiting, finally the coal downstream project, especially for the gasification project to become DME, can only be realized soon.\n\"I have repeatedly conveyed about downstream industrialization.

Even so, the area which was later called the Lampung Industrial Area (Kail), is still stagnant or has not experienced significant developments to date.\nLampung DPRD member Watoni Nurdin said the DPRD had submitted a revision to a regional regulation (perda) related to the legal basis for the management of the area by PT Kail. This was because Kail's development did not run optimally.\n\"Discussion on the revision of the 2012 regional regulations. From 2008 to 2012, PT Kail has never held a GMS (general meeting of shareholders). In fact, the GMS is one of them to make development plans. How can you proceed if you haven't even held a GMS,\" said Watoni, Thursday (30/10).\nPT Kail is a consortium consisting of PT Lestari Sentosa Industrial Estate (LSIE, Sungai Budi Group), the central government, and the Provincial Government of Lampung. The three elements each have shares of 75 percent, 20 percent and 4 percent.\nAccording to Watoni, the reason why the management of PT Kail has not held a GMS is because they have not received a recommendation from the Minister of State-Owned Enterprises (BUMN). \"But when the DPRD came to the Ministry of BUMN to confirm this, one of the director generals (Director General) at the ministry said it was not necessary. And the management of PT Kail has never submitted it to the ministry. How can a recommendation be dropped,\" said Watoni, who is also a member the special committee (pansus) for the revision of PT Kail's regional regulations in the DPRD for the 2009-2014 period.\nKail's condition, continued Watoni, did not even meet the requirements to become an industrial area. This is because supporting infrastructure for industrial activities has not been fulfilled, such as electricity networks, sewage channels, or road networks.\n\"In fact, there are no land plots for placing companies yet. The 300 hectares of land has not been added. He said, additional land is still a problem with PTPN. In fact, only 126 hectares have just been managed. Now, the area exists. However, it doesn't exist,\" said Indonesian Democratic Party of Struggle (PDIP) politician.\nAs a result of these conditions, Watoni revealed, the revision of the regional regulation failed to be finalized.

A source in November 2023 (Babel Today) speculated that the project had stalled.\n\n(Babel Today, 11/14/2023, babeltoday.com): What's The News About The Sadai Industrial Area Project Worth Trillions? Billions Of State Funds Are At Risk Of Being 'Wasted' For Nothing\n\"Now there is almost no news about the development or progress of the Sadai Industrial Area (KIS) or Sadai Integrated Industrial and Port Estate (SIIPE) development project in the Sadai Village area, Tukak Sadai District, South Bangka Regency (Basel).\nIn fact, previously Justiar Noer, when he was still the Regent of Babel, admitted that he was very optimistic regarding plans in the Basel Regency area to build a project worth trillions of rupiah in an industrial area in the Sadai area, Basel which was predicted to cost hundreds of trillions and was targeted for completion in next 2024.\nApart from that, if this mega project is realized it is hoped that it can absorb hundreds of workers. Moreover, in the implementation of the construction of the KIS project, it was reported that the Bangka Belitung Islands High Prosecutor's Office (Kejati Babel) was actually the Strategic Project Development Security Team (TPPPS).\nIt is also known that in the KIS Basel project managed by PT RBA there are at least 25 main programs including the construction of ship barriers, electronics factories, tin smelting industry (semester), rare earth metal processing factories (rear earth), glass industry, tin waste, white pepper processing factory, container terminal and fuel oil (BBM) depot as well as B3 waste processing factory.\nHowever, on the contrary, some parties, including the public, still doubt or doubt that this mega project can be realized because it is considered that the Basel Regency Government's APBD is inadequate and this hope now seems to be just a 'dream' that must be felt by itself.\nSo far, Justiar Noer has ended his position as Regent of South Bangka and is currently running as a DPD-RI candidate for the Bangka Belitung electoral district for the period 2024 – 2029.\nSadly, it is now reported that the KIS mega project is no longer running smoothly, aka 'stalled', because the private company or developer or manager of the KIS project, namely PT Ration Bangka Abadi (RBA), is currently allegedly facing problems. So what is the fate of the KIS mega project now?\nMeanwhile, information gathered by the Bangka Belitung Online News Agency (KBO Babel) team in the field as well as information from a number of sources stated that especially in the KIS project development activities, the Basel Regency Government facilitated the provision of more than 400 hectares (ha) of land for the development of KIS.\n* State projects worth billions are even built on privately owned land\nHowever, other news also states that in the implementation of the construction of the KIS project or National Strategic Project, which was built in 2018, it is suspected that there have been errors or deviations, including regarding the status of the land as a location for work activities for the construction of raw water supply facilities or Resevoir Water Systems carried out under the auspices of Ministry of PUPR PJSA Working Unit for Bangka Belitung Region and PT Gala Karya – PT Graha Anugerah Lestari.\nIt is known that the project activity for raw water supply facilities or Reservoir Air System has a total funding ceiling of IDR 75,446,927,000,- or more than IDR 75.4 billion, sourced from APBN funds for the 2023 Fiscal Year (FY).

The implementation was carried out by the PUPR Ministry, Directorate General of Water Data Resources, Bangka Belitung River Regional Office (BWS)\n\"The information is that the land status or location for the construction of the Reservoir Air System was built on land owned by PT RBA. Well, if the government wants to build this project (Reservoir Air System — ed), the land status must belong to the state and not private land. \"Unless a grant has been made, it must be done through a notarial deed,\" said this source to the KBO Babel team recently met in Sadai.\nNot only that, at the KIS location, according to this source, it is also suspected that there have been irregularities in implementation or procedures, including, among other things, project activities for the construction of a B3 waste processing plant. This waste factory has now been built at the KIS location. However, the location for the construction of this waste factory was actually built on land still owned by PT RBA.\nThis source continued that regarding the implementation of work on the construction of the Reservoir Air System, it does not rule out the possibility that it will be threatened with being discovered by the Indonesian Financial Audit Agency (BPK) because it is suspected that there have been irregularities in the use of finances or the state budget.\nPreviously, it was reported that a team from the Indonesian Ministry of Public Works and Public Housing (PUPR), Thursday (14/11/2023) had visited the location of the Sadai Industrial Area (KIS) raw water supply project in Tukak Sadai District. The PUPR Ministry team was also accompanied by the Bangka Belitung Islands Prosecutor's Office and the South Bangka Prosecutor's Office.\n* Asked about the KIS project, the former Regent of Basel admitted that he was focused on running for DPD-RI\nRegarding the issue of the KIS development project, Tukak Sadai Basel, the KBO Babel team tried to contact the former Regent of Basel, Justiar Noer via short message/What's App (WA), Saturday (11/11/2023) afternoon but he answered flatly. He even stated that he is currently focused on preparing himself to run as a candidate for DPD-RI 2024-2029.\n\"Regarding Sadai (KIS - ed.), I haven't received any further information yet, I haven't had time to meet Agek's friends, now I'm busy with visits to friends for plans for the DPD RI legislative elections,\" Justiar answered briefly.\nLikewise, when the KBO Babel team tried to confirm the progress of the KIS Basel development to the Regent of Basel, Reza Herdavid via WA message, Saturday (11/11/2023) evening he admitted that he did not know.\nIn fact, it is known that when the construction of the KiS Basel project began in 2020, Reza Herdavid was still serving as Deputy Regent of Basel.\n\"I'm not monitoring, bro,\" replied Reza briefly.\nNext, the KBO Babel team also tried to visit the office of the SNVT Working Unit for the Implementation of the Bangka Belitung Water Utilization Network (PJSA) Bangka Belitung River Region Hall, Ministry of PUPR, Monday (11/13/2023) afternoon. However, unfortunately the head of this agency was not there that afternoon.\nMeanwhile, Franky Alais Acai, Field Head of PT RBA, confirmed the progress of the KIS Basel development project, according to him, until now development activities are still ongoing. In fact, according to him, at the KIS location currently a B3 waste processing plant and a biomass power plant (PLTBM) have been built.\n“Activities for the construction of the Sadai industrial area (KIS — ed) are currently still ongoing, sir. There is already construction at the KIS location, namely a B3 waste processing factory and PLTBM. \"And other work is currently underway, namely road construction work,\" said Franky when contacted via his cellphone, Monday (13/11/2023) afternoon.\nIt is known that the project activity for building a B3 waste processing plant at the KIS location is a project of the central Ministry of Environment & Activities (KLHK) and also involves Regional Owned Enterprises (BUMD) of the Babel Provincial Government.\nWhen work began on building the B3 waste processing factory, the Director of BUMD (PT Bumi Bangka Belitung Sejahtera), Prof. Safarudin.\nHowever, when Safarudin was confirmed by the KBO Babel team regarding the KIS Basel project activities involving the BUMD of the Babel Provincial Government, he admitted that at this time he did not know anything.\n\"I'm sorry, I'm no longer at BUMD Babel, and I'm also not involved in the Sadai Industrial Zone anymore. \"So I don't know any more information about KIS,\" he replied in a WA message Monday (13/11/2023) evening.\nLikewise, when asked about the status of the land where the B3 waste factory was now built at the KIS location, he even admitted that the factory land was a grant.\n\"The land for the construction of the B3 waste factory was a grant from PT RBA to the Babel Provincial Government,\" he said. It was again asked whether there was any evidence that the land received a grant. However, Udin, as this man was known, did not answer. Instead, Udin explained something else. “Then BUMD is not implementing the project. \"The implementation is the Central Ministry of Environment,\" he said.\nSeparately, the Head of Legal Information (Penkum) of the Babel Prosecutor's Office, Basuki Raharjo SH MH, confirmed that the KIS development project activities in Tukak Sadai Village, Sadai District, South Bangka Regency were part of the Babel Prosecutor's Office as the PPPS team.

Along with easing the pandemic, we hope this government-private synergy will be able to revive the community's economy.\"\"\n\"\"This MoU between PLN and PT BAI is to prepare electrical energy for the aluminium mining industry. PLN is committed to providing sufficient power to develop the industrial sector. The hope is that it can spur national economic growth, \"\"Adi said.\nAdi explained that according to the agreement, PLN will provide 1,300 megawatts (MW) of electricity for PT BAI until 2050. However, the supply will be carried out in stages, namely 300 MW in 2026, 500 MW in 2027, and 1,300 MW in 2029-2050.\nIn this provision, PLN will prioritize the power supply from new renewable energy (EBT) based plants with massive potential in Sumatra.\nAdi added, \"\"Currently, PLN's electricity supply for the Sumatra region is already qualified with a power surplus of 1,710 MW. As the capacity of NRE power plants increases in 2026, there will be enough power available that the mining community in Sumatra can absorb.\"\"\nPT BAI's President Director, Santoni, welcomed the signing of this MoU because it will support the aluminium utilization industry in the Galang Batang SEZ. Especially for PT BAI, that will be building an aluminium smelter with a production capacity of 250,000 tonnes of aluminium annually.\n\"\"This cooperation will be mutually beneficial. The aluminium industry and its derivatives require a large amount of electrical energy. Especially for the Galang Batang SEZ, we will need 2,850 MW in the near future,” said Santoni.\nSantoni continued that PT BAI will follow government regulations to use EBT-based electricity in supplying electrical energy. So, according to him, the MoU with PLN is an alternative for the provision of EBT for PT BAI.\n\"\"Hopefully, through this MoU, PLN can provide reliable and economical electricity supply. Hopefully, the realization of this collaboration can build a productive smelter for the downstream industry of aluminium derivatives and various other industries that will be present in the Galang Batang SEZ,\"\" explained Santoni.\nAgung Murdifi, the PLN Main Unit General Manager for Riau and Riau Islands, said, \"\"This momentum was an opportunity for both parties to increase the supply and use of EBT in the industrial sector. Until July 2022, PLN's EBT mix for the Sumatra region is 27.94 per cent or equivalent to 2,427 MW, with the majority using water energy (PLTA).\"\"\n\"\"This memorandum of understanding proves that PT BAI is very committed to supplying industrial electricity from NRE. This follows the government's decision to achieve 23 per cent of the NRE mix by 2025. This commitment to clean energy is certainly our collective obligation,\"\" concluded Agung.\"\n\n(Pemerintah Provinsi Kepulauan Riau, 1/24/2022, kepriprov.go.id): \"The details of the investment development stages so far are the existence of an alumina  refinery, a PLTU with a capacity of 6x25 MW, a gas station  as a downstream coal for roasting alumina, and a dormitory for worker accommodation. \nFor the second phase, the project is planned to be completed by the end of 2024.

We are worried that this will become a serious problem considering the socio-political experience of the people in West Papua in general, who often intersect with the government, especially when it relates to indigenous peoples' land use,\" said Filep, Monday (16/1/2023)....\nIn this regard, the Deputy Chairman of Committee I DPD RI reminded about the experience of the 7 ethnic communities in Teluk Bintuni Regency regarding BP Tangguh.

This means that the government is required to have a policy to deal with social impacts, for example the rejection of indigenous peoples, refusal of compensation, including the environmental impacts caused.\n“The question is, has the regional government proposed the form or type of social impact to be analyzed by the central government? Traumatic experiences of indigenous peoples in West Papua related to development have often been experienced. Don't let this backfire on the government because the PP emphasizes that the minister facilitates problem solving in business licensing and land acquisition for National Strategic Projects,\" he said.\n\"In this PP, Ministers, governors and/or regents/mayors must prepare programs and budgets for handling social impacts for directly affected communities, namely people who control state land or land owned by the Central Government, Regional Governments, BUMN, or regionally owned enterprises, communities with land rights, or communities experiencing direct and measurable losses. Thus, social impacts, for example land acquisition for PSN in West Papua, must be resolved in an integrated, effective and efficient manner, without leaving prolonged conflicts,\" Filep added.\nOn the same occasion, Senator Filep also highlighted the dissemination which he considered not sufficiently heard regarding the location of the Pupuk Kaltim project.

According to Petrus, the determination of the location for the Bintuni Bay Industrial Area was carried out based on the results of an integrated survey initiated and carried out by the Ministry of Industry, Bappenas, Sucofindo and including PT. Indonesian fertilizer. Petrus continued, everything has been fully contained in the Feasibility Study Document (FS) which has considered various aspects, including aspects and analysis related to facilities and infrastructure. \"Various industrial supports including port development, as well as financial feasibility analysis, including the concept of industrial area planning, the survey involved various experts in their fields,\" said the Regent. As for the status of the land itself, Petrus explained that the Bintuni Bay Industrial Area at 2,112 hectares has status as an Area for Other Purposes (APL) that is no longer in contact with forest areas. \"This industrial area is a Major Project (Top Priority) which is expected to operate in the third quarter of 2024, so that in Presidential Regulation number 109 of 2020 concerning the third amendment to Presidential Decree number 3 of 2016 concerning the Acceleration of Implementation of National Strategic Projects which is expressly stipulated in the list of projects national strategy in attachment point 1,\" explained Petrus. The Regent also explained the reasons for the need for an Industrial Area in Teluk Bintuni Regency, because Bintuni Bay has natural oil and gas resources which are currently being exploited and produced by BP. Berau Ltd and Genting Oil Kasuri Pte, Ltd. It will produce gas from the Asap, Kido Merah wells in Sumuri, and is expressly contained in the Genting Oil Kasuari Genting Oil Kasuari first AMDAL document. That gas production from the ASAP, KIDO and MERAH wells will all be allocated to the Onar Sumuri Industrial Area, Teluk Bintuni. Through the Directorate General of Oil and Gas, SKK Migas represented by Fatat Yani Abdurahman, Genting Oil Kasuri represented by Nara Nilandaru and PT. Pupuk Indonesia, represented by Nugroho Christijanto, has signed an agreement. Where in the agreement Genting Oil Kasuri PTe Ltd and PT. Pupuk Indonesia agreed on a proposed gas price and gas supply of 109 MMSCFD for 17 years with the plant gate handover point for the fertilizer factory PT. Pupuk Indonesia in Bintuni, West Papua. Petrus also said that the Bintuni Bay Industrial Area project was implemented under the Public Private Partnership (PPP) scheme initiated by the Ministry of Industry and Bappenas. \"The implementation has entered the preparation stage, where the Ministry of Industry as the person in charge and the Ministry of Finance as the facility provider and PT. SMI as the party appointed by the Ministry of Finance to accompany the facility in question,\" said Regent Petrus.\"\n\n(West Papua Daily, 10/25/2021, westpapuadaily.com): \"The development of the Bintuni Bay Industrial Estate continues to be consistently accelerated by the government. The Ministry of Industry calls this effort as a form of support for the Bintuni Bay KI development plan which is carried out through the Public Private Partnership (PPP) scheme.\n“The development of Bintuni Bay KI based on the gas processing industry is carried out with the Design Build Maintenance Transfer (DBMT) scheme with a PPP period of 23 years,” said the Director General of Resilience, Territorial and International Industrial Access (KPAII) of the Ministry of Industry Eko SA Cahyanto in an official statement. on the Ministry of Industry website, Friday (10/22/2021).\nThe Director General of KPAII stated that the Bintuni Bay KI is an industrial area with the status of a national strategic project (PSN) and a priority industrial area according to the 2020-2024 RPJMN.\nThis area needs extra attention from the government to overcome obstacles in realizing industrial development in West Papua.\nThe two main challenges faced in developing Bintuni Bay IP are the land acquisition process in Onar Baru Village, Sumuri District, Teluk Bintuni Regency, West Papua Province and the certainty of gas allocation.\n“The land acquisition process should be carried out by the local government as a form of its commitment to the development of the local area,” added Eko.\nThe Regent of Bintuni Bay, Petrus Kasihiw, said that the construction of the Bintuni Bay KI is expected to be realized soon.\nIt also ensures that the location there is sterile and safe.

On PSN liar as \"Kawasan Industri Pulau Obi.\"\n\n(Kompas, 4/10/2023, lestari.kompas.com): Already has PSN status, what is the progress of the Obi Island nickel industrial area?\n\"SOUTH HALMAHERA, KOMPAS.com -  The Obi Island Industrial Area, in South Halmahera Regency, North Maluku Province, has changed its status from provincial to National Scale Development, since 2020. This follows the publication of Presidential Regulation (Pepres) of the Republic of Indonesia Number 109 of 2020, concerning the Third Amendment to Presidential Decree Number 3 of 2016 concerning the Acceleration of Implementation of National Strategic Projects. Then  the Regulation of the Coordinating Minister (Permen) for Economic Affairs Number 21 of 2022 concerning the Second Amendment to the Coordinating Minister for Economic Affairs Regulation Number 7 of 2021 concerning Changes to the PSN List. With this change in status, all kinds of supporting infrastructure for the Obi Island Industrial Area will be handled by the Ministry of Public Works and Public Housing (PUPR).\nHow is the progress currently? The industrial area built by PT Trimegah Bangun Persada (TPB) or Harita Nickel through the entity PT Dharma Cipta Mulia (DCM) is projected to require investment funds worth IDR 31.32 trillion. Director of Health, Safety and Environmental Operations Department of Harita Nickel Group, Tonny Gultom, said that the Obi Island Industrial Area was designed as a  green industrial park . \"It occupies 15,000 hectares of land and will be worked on in a former mining area,\" said Tonny on Obi Island, Saturday (8/9/2023). Currently, the Company is preparing a feasibility study , parallel to the master plan .\nTony revealed that the two stages of preparation are targeted to be approved, and then move on to the next step, namely an environmental impact analysis (AMDAL) in 2023. \"If  the master plan  is successful,  the feasibility study  is approved, the AMDAL is safe this year, then offers to investors will begin immediately,\" continued Tonny. On Obi Island itself, currently  tenants or affiliated companies are operating, namely PT Gane Permai Sentosa, PT Halmahera Jaya Feronikel and PT Megah Surya Pertiwi (MSP), including another partner company, PT Halmahera Persada Lygend (HPAL).\nMSP operates a smelter with a production capacity of 240,000 tons of ferronickel (FeNi) per year from four production lines. With nickel saprolite as raw material, nickel ore is processed through a pyrometallurgical system using Rotary Kiln-Electric Furnace (RKEF) technology. Ferronickel has a nickel content of 10-12 percent and is a semi-finished processed product which is further processed into the final product as raw material for the stainless steel industry, electronics, coins, transportation and household goods. Meanwhile, HPAL is an entity whose 45.1 percent shares are owned by TBP. This pioneer industry produces mixed hydroxide precipitate (MHP) and end products nickel sulfate and cobalt sulfate. Nickel sulfate (NiSO4) is useful as a precursor material for lithium batteries or electric vehicle batteries, while cobalt sulfate (CoSO4) is used as a cathode material for lithium batteries.\nWith the operation of MSP and HPAL, DCM decided to carry out future development as a form of mining transformation towards downstreaming. \"Because we have large reserves.  We are currently exploring two more IUPs which we will develop. The industrial area we will build is an industrial area based on nickel mining. The derivative of nickel is what we call transformation,\" explained Tonny. Therefore, he continued, the Obi Island Industrial Area will be designed with the concept of a nickel mining-based industrial area. The company opens  opportunities for investors to develop its downstream direction, including stainless steel products, electric car components, to nickel sulfate and cobalt sulfate. In the infrastructure sector, the Company ensures that it will expand ports, build airports and road infrastructure as well as a Solar Power Plant (PTSL) with a capacity of 300 MegaWatt and raw water. Tonny confirmed that the company's commitment is to carry out the government's mandate by optimizing the added value of nickel resources and providing optimal benefits. \"We realize this commitment through operations that are responsible for the environment, society and good governance,\" he said.\"\n\n(Hidranto, 6/30/2021, indonesia.go.id): \"Coordinating Minister for Maritime Affairs and Investment Luhut Binsar Pandjaitan when inaugurating the production operation of a nickel smelter using high pressure acid bleaching technology (HPAL) on Obi Island, South Halmahera, North Maluku, Wednesday ( 23/6/2021 ), suggested that the island would become a new center of growth. \"It is hoped that this area will become a center for regional development and growth in Obi Island, in particular, and in Halmahera, as well as North Maluku in general,\" he hoped...On that occasion, the Coordinating Minister Luhut was present with the Minister of Home Affairs, Minister of Transportation, Minister of Investment/BKPM, Governor of North Maluku, Regent of South Halmahera, Kakorpolairud 2 Marv, Deputy for Investment and Mining Coordination, Director General of Mineral and Coal of the Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources, and Director General of Hubud Ministry of Transportation.\nAt this inauguration, the Coordinating Minister for Luhut signed the inscription on the factory operations and initial shipment of PT Halmahera Persada Lygend's Mixed Hydroxide Precipitate (MHP) on Obi Island, North Maluku.

With the execution of the first metal tapping process, Antam will commence preparations for commercial production.”\nThe initial stages of the Haltim Feronickel Plant’s operation began on July 7, 2023, marked by the “burner-on” process, which involves heating the furnace before applying electrical current.\nFollowing the completion of the furnace process, the Haltim Feronickel Plant proceeded with the “switch on furnace” phase, officially launching the nickel smelting plant in conjunction with chromium metal.\nIn 2020, Antam continued its progress in completing Phase I Line I of the Haltim Feronickel Plant. In addition, Antam also completed the supporting infrastructure for the plant, which had been under construction since 2017.\nBy December 2020, physical construction progress of the plant had reached an impressive 98.12% completion. Alongside the feronickel processing plant, Antam continued developing supporting infrastructure in 2020, including the expansion of the town site area and other infrastructure in line with established targets and plans.\nLocated in Halmahera Timur, North Maluku, the Haltim Feronickel Plant is set to have a production capacity of 13,500 Metric Tons of Nickel in Feronickel (TNi).\nUpon full operation, it will complement the feronickel production from the Kolaka Feronickel Plant in Southeast Sulawesi, which boasts a capacity of 27,000 TNi. This will bring Antam’s installed portfolio of feronickel production capacity to an impressive 40,500 TNi.\nMoreover, the Haltim Feronickel Plant will be equipped with various key production facilities, including a 170-ton-per-hour Rotary Dryer, a 165-ton-per-hour Rotary Kiln, a 60 MW Electric Smelting Furnace, and other supporting production facilities.\"\n\n(Halmaheranesia, 9/7/2023, halmaheranesia.com): The threat to the Wato-Wato Springs, Halmahera, from the mining industry\n\"Residents of Buli, East Halmahera, North Maluku, are voicing the fate of the Wato-Wato mountains and forests which are currently becoming a mining industrial area or area.\nThrough a press release received by halmaheranesia , Said Marsaoly, a resident of Buli, said that mining activities in East Halmahera had had a negative impact on destroying residents' living spaces, from the mainland to coastal areas and small islands in the vicinity.\n\"In this area which was previously rich in nutmeg and cloves, there are 27 mining business permits (IUP), with a total concession area of ​​172,901.95 hectares,\" said Said, Wednesday, September 6 2023.\nSaid said, of the total mining permits, PT Aneka Tambang (ANTAM) is one of the largest concession holding companies that controls the mainland area of ​​Halmahera, down to the small islands of Gee and Pakal.\nAccording to him, apart from PT Antam's operations, now Mount Wato-Wato, which is important for residents, is also being targeted by PT Priven Lestari. On Mount Wato-Wato there are protected forest areas and village forests which function as water catchment areas.\n\"From the Wato-Wato forest area, there are springs that flow through three large rivers and several tributaries which have been the main source of water for thousands of residents, and have even become a source of raw water for PDAM Buli,\" he said.\nApart from that, at the foot of Mount Wato-Wato there are also residents' agricultural land planted with nutmeg, cloves and pineapples. All of this is the main source of the people's economy.\nNow, he said, the government and PT Priven Lestari's efforts to open a mining industry on Mount Wato-Wato have the potential to wipe out the entire source of life for these residents.\n\"This coercive effort can be seen from the public discussion or consultation process on AMDAL documents from 2015 to 2018 which did not accommodate residents' voices of objection,\" he explained.\nHe explained that the series of acts of resistance by residents so far has actually been responded to with attempts to criminalize residents who refuse mining.\n\"This criminalization effort can be seen from the appearance of summons from the police against eleven residents who refused mining in July 2023, on charges of abuse, threats and vandalism,\" he said.\nIn fact, what the residents are doing is simply defending their last living space, namely Mount Wato-Wato, from the mining industry.He said that based on this situation, the residents of East Halmahera, who had gathered in the Buli Caring Wato-Wato Community Alliance, pressed for several demands.\n“Urge the Minister of Energy and Mineral Resources to immediately stop and revoke PT Priven Lestari's mining permit. \"Urge the Minister of Environment and Forestry not to process the application for a Borrow-to-Use Forest Area Permit (IPPKH) for PT Priven Lestari, and to impose strict legal sanctions for its operations that damage forest areas,\" he explained.\nThen, they also urged the police to stop the legal process against the residents who reported it, and asked the Regent and DPRD of Haltim, the Governor and DPRD of North Maluku to immediately issue a recommendation to stop operations and revoke PT Priven Lestari's permit to the Minister of Energy and Mineral Resources.\n\"Urge Komnas HAM to conduct an investigation into alleged human rights violations committed by PT Priven Lestari, the government and the police,\" concluded Said.\nUntil this news was broadcast, PT Priven Lestari and other parties were trying to confirm the pressure from Buli residents.\"\n\n(ANTAM, 1/3/2023, antam.com): \"PT Aneka Tambang Tbk (ANTAM; IDX: ANTM; ASX: ATM) member of Mining Industry Indonesia (MIND ID) - the State-Owned Enterprise Holding of the Mining Industry Indonesia, focused on implementation of downstream-based initiative strategic development to increase the added value of mining product and strengthen the Company's core business, including the completion of Haltim Ferronickel Plant Development Project with its supporting infrastructure, entering construction project phase.\nAs a follow-up activity in the implementation of the Power Purchase Agreement (PJBTL) of the electricity supply for the East Halmahera Ferronickel Plant between ANTAM and PT Perusahaan Listrik Negara (Persero) (PT PLN) was signed on March.

The IDX debut is slated for April 18.\n\"We're currently in an early stage to expand to the downstream industry along the EV battery value chain,\" Merdeka Battery President Devin Ridwan said in a written statement on Thursday. \"Through this IPO, [Merdeka Battery] will ensure that our corporate strategic plans will progress maximally.\"\nIndonesia is the world's biggest nickel producer and holds the largest proven reserves of the metal, a key component in long-range electric vehicle batteries. Companies like Merdeka and other nickel miners hope to ride on the government's push to utilize the country's reserves to develop a battery industry, enter the global EV supply chain and develop a manufacturing base. With a population of more than 270 million, Indonesia also offers a potentially huge market for EVs.\nMerdeka Battery earlier this month unveiled a plan to develop its first high-pressure acid leach (HPAL) plant at the Indonesia Konawe Industrial Park, a nickel industrial complex on the southeastern part of Sulawesi island, Indonesia's nickel heartland. The HPAL technology is used to refine Indonesia's low-grade nickel ore into battery-grade materials.

In Routa District, Regent Kery facilitated the entry of PT.Sulawesi Cahaya Mineral (SCM) through the flag of PT.Indonesia Konawe Industrial Park (IKIP) which invested around IDR 58 trillion in capital. Mining activities in Routa are currently underway. PT.IKIP will explore over the mining business permit area (IUP) owned by PT.SCM, which is an area of ​​3,563 hectares. The corporation is currently building an industrial complex with various other supporting infrastructure. \nThe presence of investment in Routa is projected to absorb around six to eight thousand workers. It is believed that the absorption of so many workers will alleviate unemployment. Routa, which was previously branded as a marginal area, is now predicted to become a developed area thanks to the influx of investment in the region. \nKonawe Regent Kery Saiful Konggoasa said, through private investment in Routa, nickel factories and other derivatives will be built in that area. This includes nickel derivatives, namely lithium, which is used as a raw material for making electric vehicle batteries. \"We are grateful for the investment in Routa. We need the investment in order to accelerate regional progress. This investment will also help us overcome employment problems in Konawe,\" Regent Kery told Kendari Pos yesterday. \nMeanwhile, Konawe Secretary (Sekab) Konawe Ferdinand Sapan stated, PT.SCM has so far continued to improve the progress of the development of industrial estates in Routa. Including, the acceleration of the production process this year from the initial target in 2024. Ferdinand said, the Konawe Regency Government had also provided support as a form of support for accelerating the development of industrial estates in Routa by PT. SCM. \n\"The government's support, one of which is that we accelerate the Routa Detailed Spatial Plan (RDTR). Thus, when corporations build their industrial estates or other supporting areas related to industry, it will have a positive impact on the community. That's why, we have to prepare the RDTR from the start ,\" he explained. \nWith that support, said Ferdinand Sapan, PT.SCM will consistently prioritize all the potential that exists in Konawe to support the company's production activities. Whether it's the potential of natural resources (SDA) or human resources (HR). \nThe former Head of BPKAD Konawe admitted that on various occasions when he met delegations from PT. SCM, he always asked the corporation to prioritize local potential rather than looking elsewhere. \"One of the things I conveyed to the company, if they need to eat there and still eat from rice, never buy rice from other places. They have to buy rice from Konawe. Later, if Konawe can't afford it, then look elsewhere,\" said Ferdinand Sapa. He said, to further strengthen the commitment between the government and the private sector regarding investment in Routa, the Konawe Regency Government will also make a memorandum of understanding with PT.SCM. For example, the Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) related to the concept of managing Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) funds which is the responsibility of the company. \n\"So we use methods like that. The MoU includes the education sector. Later we will try to convey that our human resources need to be pushed or increased in level. So that the company must take a role in it,\" explained Ferdy, the nickname of the Regency Secretary. Konawe it. \nFerdy continued, industrial activity in Routa by PT. SCM, would certainly open up new jobs in the local authorities. Many Konawe local workers (TKL) can be recruited by the company. Ferdinand Sapan said, the latest report from PT. SCM, 2,500 workers had been recruited to build the mega industrial complex in the westernmost region of Konawe. But the problem going forward, he continued, is when corporations need skilled workers (skills). Meanwhile, the readiness of Konawe's human resources with special skills is still relatively low. \"One of the things we have prepared is the later integration of the need for skilled workers from the Polytechnic in Morosi. And also, later we will build other vocations. We will also try to communicate with other universities. Both in Konawe as well as in the provincial capital,\" concluded Ferdy.

AMNT has written a letter to KSB containing a request for facilitation of land acquisition in Otak Keris Hamlet, which incidentally is a village area. Initially the Regional Government of KSB hoped that the Smelter could be built in the coastal area, especially where PT. AMNT already owns around 200 hectares of land.\n''However, technically the location did not meet the requirements, so during the trip the Otak Keris area was chosen, even though this is a village area,'' he said.\nOtak Keris is included in the plan to establish an industrial area with an area of ​​1,164 hectares. Because it will be used as an industrial zone, land in hamlets with around 60 families is included in the land acquisition priority.\n''What was needed at that time was 150 hectares, plus another 20 hectares. So more or less what we have freed is around 170 hectares, and it's all clear . Until the last, around 61 hectares, the settlement was through the courts. It's already inrah, the decision from the Supreme Court has also been passed,''explained the Regent.\nMusyafirin admitted that he is very optimistic that this smelter will definitely be realized, especially since his party has moved very far to realize this project. It's just that the Covid-19 pandemic has hampered this program a bit, but in principle this smelter will still be built according to plan.\nCurrently, in preparation for the construction of a smelter, camps or workers' camps are being built with a total of around 2000 – 3000 camps. An engaged workforce with prioritizing local labour. Even now, the Integrated Team tasked with recruiting workers is currently selecting around 1,200 workers for smelter preparation.\n Regarding the proportion of local workers in the construction of this smelter, the Regional Government of KSB certainly prioritizes local workers and local resources for company needs. Likewise other resources such as building materials and food needs so that PT. AMNT absorbs the maximum from the local community.\n“In every meeting with AMNT, we always convey that local resources must be a priority. Local resources such as materials, sand, crushed stone, as well as local materials such as rice, vegetables and others. Including labor resources, it must be prioritized from KSB,\" he said.\nThe KSB Regent admitted that he had drafted a regional regulation so that it was the responsibility of the company, and all sub-contractors working in KSB to use local human resources of at least 40 percent. Prior to drafting this Perda, a Perbup first appeared which required companies to absorb local workers and other local resources with a minimum amount of 60 percent.\n“However, we will make a regional regulation for a minimum of 40 percent of resources. Moreover, the central government has asked that spending on local products be at least 40 percent in the regional budget. We try to comply with regulations,\" he explained.\nThe Regional Government of KSB has conducted a comparative study in Gresik, East Java to take a close look at the smelter industry there and its derivative industries. The Department of Manpower has been given orders to train local workers to become skilled by inviting the involvement of PT. AMNT.

From the results of the survey, 4 aspects were obtained which had sufficient evidence, namely; licensing/non-licensing aspects, project preparation aspects, spatial planning aspects and land provision aspects. While the other 9 aspects, namely funding, government guarantees, procurement of goods/services, project development implementation, prioritizing domestic components, supervision and control, project regulations, work creation aspects and aspects of utilization do not yet have strong evidence or supporting data.\nIt is hoped that the BPKP will be able to obtain updated information from the NTB Provincial Government, West Sumbawa Regency Government and PT. Amman Mineral Nusa Tenggara (PT. AMNT) so that BPKP can carry out a comprehensive and integrated cross-sector supervisory role in overseeing the Development of Industrial Estates in West Sumbawa Regency which can ultimately fulfill development accountability in achieving the RPJMN project targets, the NTB Provincial RPJMD and the President's priority programs.\nThe current issues of smelter development discussed include:\nThe issue of land acquisition, where in the 154 hectares of land for smelter construction there is still land that has not been acquired;\nChanges to the construction schedule and completion of the smelter construction which was originally planned to be completed in 2022 to 2023;\nChange in production capacity from 1.3 MTPA to 0.9 MTPA;\nThe progress of the smelter development has not been significant.\nIn response to this problem, the NTB Provincial BAPPEDA represented by the Young Expert Planning Functional (B.
