In a take or pay scheme, the components calculated as the basis for the billing of capacity payments are the components of the investment cost and fixed operating and maintenance cost that represent payment for the plant Net Power. As a condition, BP should always maintain the availability of its power plant in accordance with operational plan and dispatch request from P2B including maintaining gas availability from gas provider required for power plant operation. Up to now, BP always meets the terms and conditions needed to be able to issue invoice to PLN.

Rudi Wijaya, President Director of PT Millennium Power, said that PT PGN's willingness to supply gas for the PLTGU which will be built in the Millennium Industrial Estate area is a big capital for the company to accelerate the realization of the construction of this power plant . “This is a big event for us by getting gas support from PT PGN. \"Previously, PT PGN had supplied gas to tenants in the Millennium industrial area,\" he said in Jakarta, when signing the HoA, Wednesday (1/4/2015). Jobi Triananda Hasjim, Director of Business at PT PGN Tbk., said that the construction of a 1,000 MW PLTGU is a big project that is really needed by industry, especially in delivering electricity in the West Java region.\nIn the future, he continued, not only PT Millennium Power will be supported in supplying gas for PLTGU, but other parties such as PT Perusahaan Perusahaan Perusahaan Negara (PLN) which is actively replacing fuel oil-based power plants will also be fully supported by PGN. He said, with the volume of gas requested by PT Millennium Power up to 2024 being quite large, it is hoped that this collaboration can soon be upgraded to an agreement so that PGN can immediately search for and increase its gas supply. According to him, even though Indonesia's macroeconomy is currently unstable, in line with increasingly rapid industrial growth, electricity supply capacity to this sector must continue to be increased. Lebinner Sinaga, Tangerang Area Manager of PT PGN Tbk., said that the construction of the PLTGU will be carried out in four stages until 2024. The first stage of construction is targeted for completion in the first quarter of 2017 with a total volume of gas used of 40 million cubic meters.\n\"The total gas that will be supplied by PGN until the final stage of development reaches 240 million cubic meters,\" he said to Bisnis.

This CCPP has two units of Gas Turbine Generator (GTG), two units of Heat Recovery Steam Generator (HRSG) and one unit of Steam Turbine Generator (STG)...\nPower Network Distribution System\nPT KDL's transmission and distribution network is in the form of an underground electricity network. In terms of reliability, compared with overhead network, underground electricity network will be easier and safer to operate than overhead network. About 95 percent of PT KDL's distribution network uses ring system cable channels.\nThe distribution mechanism of PT KDL's electricity starts from the generation of electrical energy in each generator of 10.5 kilovolts (kV). In order to be properly channeled, the voltage is then increased to 150 kV to the divider rail (busbar). From each of these busbar voltages that have been adjusted are channeled to each customer of PT KDL ranging from 30 kV, 20 kV, 6 kV to 400 Volts.\nPT KDL guarantees the quality of electrical energy produced according to industry standards. For this reason, PT KDL built a compensator system to maintain voltage stability. PT Krakatau Steel (Persero) Tbk. as the main consumer, gets the installation of compensator systems in each of its factory.\nInterconnection with PLN\nInitially PT KDL plant designed to operate independently (isolated system). But over time, the growth of many new factories in the Krakatau Industrial Estate also create new demand to PT KDL. To anticipate this, PT KDL’s CCPP interconnected with PLN. PT KDL's transmission network is interconnected with PLN's 150 kV network through High Voltage Air Conducting (HUTT).\nRecently, the electricity supply contract from PLN is 200 MVA. Since August 2003, this supply contract expanded with an agreement to synergize electricity delivery between PLN, PT KS, and PT KDL. This is to compensate the condition of the electricity crisis during the Peak Load Time (WBP). During an emergency, this interconnection network will work hand in hand in the power plant start-up process.\"\n\n(Indonesia Industrial Estates Directory 2018-2019, 2019, business-indonesia.org): \"Electricity: PT PLN (Persero), PT Krakatau Daya Listrik\nCapacity: 3,400 MVA\"", "Electricity Capacity (MW)": 320.0, "GEM": null, "Latitude": -6.000831, "Longitude": 106.043214, "Sources": "https://dinsights.katadata.co.id/read/2023/06/14/krakatau-industrial-estate-sold-94-of-its-landbank\nhttps://ekonomi.bisnis.com/read/20190102/47/874696/kiec-kembangkan-kawasan-industri-iii-420-hektare\nhttps://en.antaranews.com/news/256333/ksp-invites-south-korean-companies-to-invest-in-cilegon-estate\nhttps://www.antaranews.com/berita/3585459/kawasan-industri-yang-dikelola-pt-ksp-tersisa-40-hektare\n(Archived link, 11/27/23) https://web.archive.org/web/20231127172956/https://kemenperin.go.id/kawasan\nhttps://kiec.co.id/id/\nhttps://kiec.co.id/en/industrial-area-3/\n(Archived link, 5/18/2024) https://web.archive.org/web/20240518022508/https://www.energytransitionpartnership.org/uploads/2022/09/The-Electricity-Infrastructure-Planning-and-Investment-Needs-to-Support-Energy-Transition.pdf\nhttps://business-indonesia.org/files/estates/XqRIF7ytNNH618MbKBFjEY7Va1y02Ov9Tf968LY7.pdf\nhttps://kce.co.id/product/energy" }, "geometry": { "type": "Point", "coordinates": [ 106.043214, -6.000831 ] } },

PT Growth Asia is a company under the management of the Growth Steel Group (GSG) with an integrated steel industry core business.\nThis 2 x 15 MW Biomass PLTU was built in 2011 and uses fuel from renewable energy, namely palm shells, rice husks, corn cobs and wood dust ( Waste to Energy ).\nThe construction of the Biomass PLTU is basically intended to meet its own needs. However, the power produced exceeds requirements, so there is excess power of 20 MW. The excess electrical power is sold to PT. PLN (Persero) North Sumatra Region.\nPreviously, PT. Growth Sumatra Industry, also one of the companies under the management of the Growth Steel Group, has built 1 x 15 MW in 2008 and 1 x 15 MW in 2010.

ELECTRICAL SYSTEM INTEGRATION\nElectrical System Integration (ESI) is a unit that functions to distribute electrical power from several factory generators in the PT Pupuk Kalimantan Timur Industrial Area. Electrical power from each generator can be used for the needs of each factory. With the ESI Unit, electrical power from one factory can be used for other factories via the Main Ring Unit.\nThe ESI unit was built by KDM in 2007 and is very useful for continuing production in factories in the PT Pupuk Kalimantan Timur Industrial Area. This is because if the electricity generator of one of the factories connected to the ESI Unit experiences a problem and results in it tripping or shutting down, then the electricity consumption at that factory can be supplied from another factory's generator. The electrical network supplied uses a voltage of 33 kV and is maintained at a frequency of 50 Hz for equipment stability\"\n\n(PT Kaltim Daya Mandiri LinkedIn, n.d., linkedin.com): About\n\"PT Kaltim Daya Mandiri is a subsidiary of PT Pupuk Indonesia Energi.

The facility will be equipped with a 20 MWh (megaWatt hours) battery energy storage system. \n“SESNA has been selected as the project initiator and will own, build, test, finance and operate the solar project farm,” the company’s Marketing Manager Atikah Amaliadanti told Indonesia Business Post on June 2, 2022.\nShe did not reveal the amount invested in the project. She said, however, that the company would be open to collaborating with potential partners in the development of this project, including obtaining financing from abroad.\n“We are open to various collaboration schemes not only for this project but for future projects as well,” Amaliadanti.\nNickel Mines plans to utilize renewable energy by producing electricity to nickel processing sites in its operational areas.\nThe project will be supported by technology and equipment imported from suppliers and vendors in Europe and China. The majority of suppliers are top-tier manufacturers. The company is open to opportunities for technology and equipment suppliers from the United States, Europe, and China.\nThe project is currently in its development phase, which includes study, technical analysis and preparation of Detailed Engineering Design based on the survey. The timeline for the construction and operation will be based on the study results.\n“We are optimistic that this project will proceed smoothly,” Amaliadanti said, adding that procurement and construction schedules will be synchronized. Pre-construction preparations will be discussed so that construction can begin as soon as possible.\n“As part of the company’s commitment to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, we are pleased to maintain a good relationship with SESNA through the signing of this MoU for a 200 MWp solar power project,” said Nickel Mines Managing Director Justin Werner in January 2022.\nAccording to the agreement, Nickel Mines will be responsible for the cost based on their monthly power usage. “In addition to efficient operation costs, Nickel Mines will also benefit from guaranteed operations and maintenance,” Amaliadanti concluded.\nThe total planned capacity of the solar farm project is 396kWp (kiloWatt peak) plus 250kWh (kiloWatt hour) of battery storage at Hengjaya Nickel Mine which is 80% owned by Nickel Mines.

The state-owned stun company has signed an Electricity Sales and Purchase Letter (SJBTL) with the Dumai Industrial Area (KID) manager PT Wilmar Nabati Indonesia (Wina), in Jakarta, Wednesday (15/11/2017).  This SJBTL was signed by Irwansyah M. Putra as General Manager of PLN Riau and Riau Islands Region (WRKR) with Erik Tjia as Deputy Director of PT Wilmar Nabati Indonesia, witnessed by PLN Sumatra Regional Business Director Wiluyo Kusdwiharto.  Currently, KID requires around 35 megawatt hours (MWH) of electricity. So far, KID, which has its own steam power plant (PLTU), supplies coal from Kalimantan.  Deputy Director of PT Wilmar Nabati Erik Tjia said that the collaboration was to increase the electricity capacity of the industrial area on the west coast of Riau to develop its derivative industries.  He admitted that with this additional power, the Malaysian company saved 100 to 200 kwh or IDR 1.2 billion per year.  \"Coal prices are increasing. With this collaboration, we no longer need to think about electricity supply,\" he said to businesses on the sidelines of the cooperation signing event, Wednesday (15/11/2017).  Vienna is currently the largest PLN customer in Riau which will be a positive signal for the economic growth of Riau province. In the future, not only will the need for electricity increase, but PT WINA's production capacity will also increase and factories and industries derived from palm oil will be built in this area so that it can create new jobs. PLN Sumatra Regional Business Director Wiluyo said, in order to meet the demand for 60 MVA, PLN is building a 150 kV High Voltage Overhead Line (SUTT) 27 km long from the Dumai 150 kV Main Substation which is currently still under construction. Wiluyo is optimistic that this project can be completed in Semester I 2018. \"We will fulfill the first stage according to demand. However, if there is additional electricity, PLN is ready to distribute any amount of electricity,\" he said.  Riau has an installed electricity capacity of 620 MW with a reserve power of 200 MW. However, Riau still needs to build transmission and substations to deliver electricity to other industries and households.  The Riau Provincial Government continues to encourage the acceleration of transmission and substation construction. Syahrial Abdi, Head of the Riau Province Energy and Mineral Resources (ESDM) Service, said that the electricity infrastructure was built in several strategic locations to connect to industrial areas and areas that need electricity. \"The government continues to accelerate. Infrastructure development was hampered by land and other problems.

PLTU Suge also powers most of Belitung, but has had repeated issues with power outages. A palm oil power plant pilot took place at Kawasan Industri Suge in 2018. The regional government has also suggested the development of a solar power station at Kawasan Industri Suge.\n\n(Regional.Kontan.Co.Id, 5/18/2023): 100 Hectares of Land Prepared for PLTS Belitung\n\"100 hectares of land in the Suge industrial area, Pegantian Village, Belitung , Bangka Belitung Islands has been prepared as a location for a solar power plant (PLTS ). The regional government considers that PLTS is needed to maintain the reliability of electricity supply while supporting environmentally friendly tourism programs. \"We have conveyed it to the Ministry of Maritime Affairs and Fisheries to build PLTS energy,\" said Belitung Deputy Regent Isyak Meirobie to Kompas.com , Wednesday (17/5/2023).\nIsyak conveyed this regarding blackouts that often occur due to disruption of the Suge Steam Power Plant (PLTU). Previously there was a disturbance in the form of a furnace leak at the coal-fired generator. On Wednesday afternoon, disruption occurred again due to a lightning strike at a substation located in the PLTU area.\n\"It's no longer suitable for a leading destination like this, PLTU Suge can no longer afford it,\" said Isyak. Isyak hopes that the central government will immediately conduct a study for the construction of PLTS in Belitung, including estimates of costs and environmental impacts. The construction of PLTS is considered to be in line with the zero emissions or Net Zero Emissions (NZE) target which is targeted to be achieved by 2060. On the other hand, Isyak also expressed support if the government had alternative options to guarantee electricity supply in Belitung. One of them is related to the plan to build a Sumatran sea cable interconnection via Sadai, South Bangka. \"We hope that it will be realized soon,\" concluded Isyak.\"\n\nbelitung.tribunnews.com, 12/18/2018: Belitung Regent Inspects 5 MW Power Plant Fueled by Palm Oil\n\"REGENCY of Belitung H Sahani Saleh (Sanem) inspected the 5 MW power plant built by BUMD PT Belitung Mandiri in the Suge Industrial Area , Pegantin Village, Badau District, Belitung Regency, Monday (17/12).\nThis power plant, which uses crude palm oil (CPO) as fuel,  is prepared to support the supply of electrical energy in the Suge industrial area.\nAlso attending the review were Assistant for Economics and Development at the Regional Secretariat (Setda) of the Regional Government of Belitung Regency Jasagung Heriyadi, Head of the Belitung Regency Environmental Service (DLH) Ubaidillah, Head of the One Stop Integrated Investment and Industry Service of Belitung Regency Hilman.\nApart from that, there were also the Acting Head of the Belitung Regency Public Works and Public Housing (PUPR) Department, Agus Siregar, the Head of the Economic Section of the Belitung Regional Government Secretariat M Iqbal and the Director of PT Belitong Mandiri BUMD Azrul Anwar.\n\"This was already underway in January 2019. This is a pilot project for renewable energy, using CPO fuel,\" said Sanem during the inspection, Monday (17/12).\nSanem said, this CPO-fueled power plant will be inaugurated by the Minister of Energy and Mineral Resources (ESDM) Ignasius Jonan.\n\"We have already done the sounding with PLN, the only thing left now is the operation, everything is ready. The raw materials will be working with PT PUS for the CPO,\" said Sanem.\nSanem hopes that all people who have private oil palm plantations will sell their palm oil to PT PUS so that all fuel needs for this power plant can be met.\n\"Because there will be no term for palm oil to expire, all palm fruit goes into the factory process and is made into CPO. So the electricity will be purchased by PLN because PLN is the one who distributes it. It is also possible for companies in industrial areas to buy the electricity directly,\" he said. .\nSanem said this 5 MW power plant is environmentally friendly. \"We hope that factories in the Suge Industrial area will buy electrical power there. Even though PLN will buy the power later for distribution and this is really a pilot project in Indonesia,\" he said.

The Envision Group is a world-leading green technology company, as well as a zero carbon technology partner... The exploration of this collaboration was marked by the presence of Indonesia Region Senior Development Manager, Hermanto together with Envision Group Senior development manager, Nico Li. Both of them explained the potential of wind power recorded through satellite technology which they called Greenwich. \"Through this greenwich, we can see what the potential for wind power in Bantaeng is like. Therefore, we plan to develop a PLTB in Bantaeng Regency,\" explained Hermanto. He said, in general, Bantaeng has good wind power potential. He said, if this cooperation runs smoothly, then Bantaeng can have 67 PLTB points spread across a number of areas in Bantaeng Regency. \"With that potential, Bantaeng can supply as much as 867 MWH of electricity,\" he said... He added, the 67 PLTB towers being built will have an investment value of up to IDR 6.7 trillion. This investment value will have a positive impact on the socio-economic community in Bantaeng. \"We also want to participate in developing the Bantaeng industrial area which is zero carbon. With the existence of this PLTB, other investments will enter Bantaeng because we see Bantaeng as an environmentally friendly industrial area,\" he said. Meanwhile, the Regent of Bantaeng, Ilham Azikin welcomed the planned presence of the Envision Group in Bantaeng Regency. He said, Bantaeng is an area that is open to all investment opportunities. He admitted that he was interested in the PLTB development plan in Bantaeng. He even suggested being able to design PLTB development in the Bantaeng offshore area (Out Source)... Indonesia Region Senior Development Manager Envision Group, Hermanto shows the process of analyzing wind energy potential which is done digitally with the help of satellites. This analysis process is carried out with the help of an application called Greenwich. From the results of this analysis, almost all areas in Bantaeng have sufficient wind energy potential to build a PLTB. However, the picture from the Greenwich application must be strengthened by the construction of a wind measuring tower as a condition for applying for a permit at PT PLN. \"We have determined the location of this wind measuring tower. The point is in Bantaeng District,\" he explained. He said, in the near future, Envision will sign a collaboration with the Bantaeng Regency Government to start this project. After signing the agreement, Envision will start building this wind measuring tower.  \"This wind measuring tower will work for almost a year to ensure wind speed in Bantaeng,\" he explained.  Hermanto hopes that this cooperation with the Bantaeng Regency Government can be realized in the near future. He targets that this collaboration will be signed by the end of October.

Susiwijono said that his arrival at the Nonga Digital Park KEK was in order to follow up on the results of the meeting between the BP Batam Supervisory Board and the leadership within BP Batam. At the meeting, there was an agreement between the Supervisory Board and BP Batam to follow up on a number of potential new investments in the future. One of them is the potential for investment in the Nongsa Digital Park KEK. \"Because the Nongsa SEZ is our mainstay. \"Especially, related to the digital economy and also investments related to data centers and so on,\" explained Susiwijono.\nThe data center , which was built on an area of ​​28,730 square meters with an investment commitment of IDR 4 trillion from PT GDS IDC Service from Hong Kong, is a tier 3 data center with a capacity of 40 MW. This data center facility will be developed in two stages of 20 MW each. \"Earlier we saw that the progress was very good, so construction is really continuing. \"So we hope that this NDP KEK will encourage all sectors in Batam,\" explained Susiwijono. To support the smooth investment of the world's largest data center in the NDP SEZ, infrastructure support is needed to supply electrical energy and water. Regarding electricity and water needs, Susiwijono together with BP Batam and PLN Batam have discussed it, so that the supply that will be distributed to the NDP KEK can be maximally met.\nThis is done so that NDP SEZs can compete not only with neighboring countries such as Singapore and Malaysia. But it also competes with other world countries. “The government is very committed to continuing to encourage (fulfillment of needs) in order to increase competitiveness. \"So that our competitiveness can become an attraction for new investment here,\" explained Susiwijono.

But, disputes like this are not uncommon in Indonesia due to the lack of legal clarity, analyst said.\nKHE initiated in 2008 the Kayan Cascade project, which will consist of five dams along the Kayan River and equipped with five to six turbines.\nThe company in October 2022 signed an agreement with Sumitomo to co-develop the project, which is estimated to need around USD 17.8 billion in total investment. Prior to the agreement with Sumitomo, KHE had signed an agreement with China Power on 16 August 2019 for the same project, local media reported.\nYet, the company is still receptive to onboarding other investors into the mega project, t. It will prioritise potential investors who have already held talks with it or those who will be introduced by its partners, Suryali stated.\nInitial infrastructure works have been done and KHE plans to start constructing the first dam diversion channel this year, Suryali had said on the sidelines of the KHE-Sumitomo signing ceremony on 6 October in Jakarta.\nThe first plant will have 900-MW capacity; the second, 1,200MW; while the third and fourth will have 1,800 MW each, and the fifth 3,400 MW.
