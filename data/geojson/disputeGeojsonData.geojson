The disposal of factory liquid waste at Hyundai is not in accordance with regulations.\n\"Hyundai admits its guilt,\" said Head of the Civil and Administrative Section of the Cikarang District Attorney Rolando Ritonga recently.\nRolando said, Hyundai did not extend the liquid waste disposal permit (IPL C). Hyundai's industrial waste has also exceeded the quality standard threshold.\n\"Results of a study by the Ministry of Environment, the Cikadu river, which flows into the CBL river to the sea, is experiencing extraordinary pollution due to Hyundai's waste disposal,\" said Rolando.\nThe lawsuit was then settled for Rp. 2 billion\nOn June 6, 2014, the Bekasi Regency Government sued PT Hyundai Inti Development in a civil lawsuit with a compensation value of IDR 16 billion.\nPT Hyundai Inti Development is the manager of the Hyundai industrial area and is responsible for permitting the disposal of liquid waste from local factories.\nThe value of IDR 16 billion is determined based on calculations from the Ministry of Environment experts. \"Compensation is calculated from 2010 to February 2014,\" said Rolando.\nInitially, the government and Hyundai negotiated out of court. Hyundai stated that it was only able to pay compensation of 147 million. The government refused.\nHyundai then increased its offer to Rp 200 million, but the government still refused. Finally, Hyundai agreed to Rp 400 million. The government still refuses.\n“Finally brought to court. The government and Hyundai agreed on a figure of Rp 2 billion. It must be paid no later than November 2015. The money goes to the regional administration,\" said Rolando.\nIn addition to paying Rp 2 billion, Hyundai is required to repair the sewage system so there will be no more pollution. Within 8 months, the canal repair should be completed.\n\"If it doesn't complete the repairs within the allotted time, Hyundai will have to pay Rp 5 billion. That's the deal,\" he said.\nPT Hyundai Inti Development's lawyer, Army Mulyanto, explained that his client had paid Rp. 1 billion to the West Java Bank (BJB) account belonging to the Bekasi Regency Government.\n\"Hyundai has paid Rp. 1 billion in early October. The drawback, another Rp. 1 billion, is paid no later than 30 days after the first payment,\" said Army.\nAccording to the Army, Hyundai is also working on repairing the sewage channel that will flow into the Cikadu River as agreed with the government.\n“Hyundai will fulfill all the agreements. As for channel repairs, Hyundai is currently repairing them,\" said Army.\nJust to note, the Hyundai Bekasi industrial area was built by PT Hyundai Inti Development on an area of ​​200 hectares in Bekasi Regency and was operational in 1991.\nPT Hyundai Inti Development is a joint venture between Hyundai Corporation (South Korea) and PT. Lippo Cikarang Tbk.\nPT Lippo Cikarang Tbk (Lippo Group) itself is a company that owns and manages a number of industrial estates in Bekasi Regency. These include the EJIP industrial area, Delta Silicon 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 and 7. This includes Hyundai.\nCurrently, Lippo Cikarang is also developing an area called Delta Silicon 8 on an area of ​​250 hectares.

On Tuesday (21/07/2020) A number of Lippo delegates came to the regent's office. A number of officials welcomed their arrival directly. Not many people know what the discussion points between the Lippo envoy and the officials at the regent's office were. However, it is alleged that one of them discussed the Rolling Hills housing development project, which allegedly did not yet have the supporting documents to issue a Building Construction Permit (IMB). One of the requirements is Andalalin and UKL/UPL. This project can be seen immediately if you enter via the West Karawang access to the main access to KIIC, to be precise at KJIE. Soil dumping or cut an fill has begun. \"Three house buildings prepared as examples are already standing at the very front, to the east of the access to KIIC,\" said Askun.

Including the provision of facilities such as shopping centers. Promos and product offers are spread everywhere. \"Yes, there is a meeting,\" said one person who confirmed that there was a meeting between Lippo representatives and a number of officials. Legal practitioner, Asep Agustian (Askun) \"asked the Karawang Regency Government not to be careless and just make it easier to issue permits,\" said Askun. even though the one who owns the business is the Lippo Group. You have to think about the impact, if it has the potential to cause flooding. “Whoever takes care of the permit must comply with the procedures and rules. I also ask law enforcers not to be lax. You have to be involved in monitoring, it's impossible, for example, the class of Head of Intelligence at the Prosecutor's Office doesn't know. Call, ask for information. \"That's the prosecutor's intelligence job,\" said Askun. He also asked law enforcement to monitor the Rolling Hills permit application process. “Whoever owns it still has to comply with local government regulations. \"Don't let people become victims again, so if the policy is changed, then change it,\" he said. \"It's said that someone who got the power of attorney was from Karawang, that's the procedure that was followed,\" said Askun. Yang said there were people from Karawang who were also involved in taking care of the permits. Previously, the Head of DLHK Karawang, Wawan Setiawan, told the media crew \"once expressed his frustration, because he sent a summons to the KJIE but was ignored, PT KJIE management never came to attend the DLHK Karawang summons,\" said Wawan. \"Yes, we should be more respectful, we have already sent a second summons , \" said Wawan on July 7 2020 to the media crew.\" (Kontan, 6/3/2020, investasi.kontan.co.id): Karawang West Java Industrial Estate postponed paying interest on debt securities of IDR 457 billion he list of companies delaying interest payments on debt securities is growing longer.

In 2016, Tatang Sofyan, the Head of the Land Agency of Sukabumi Regency and Rudolf Imam Santoso, among others, were designated suspects by the Cibadak State Prosecutor's Office in a corruption case over potential bribery in the transfer of state HGU land from PT Tenjojaya in Tenjoyaya Village to PT Bogorindo Cemergland.\n\nBased on an article by Seputar Jagat MP (2021), it appears that the land, which was formerly owned by PT. Tenjojaya, should have been returned to the state and accessible to over 100 local village cultivators (who have worked on the land since the 1970s) when PT. Tenjojaya's HGU expired. Instead, the HGU was transferred to Rudolf Imam Santoso, the head of PT Bogorindo. In 2021, it was reported that the land that had been transfered to PT. Bogorindo included structures built by Tenjojaya residents, such as the village office and schools, and that the community requested compensation and information on the ownership status of the land. \n\nOn June 26, 2022, it was reported by Mata Investigasi that Patty Nurchalis disclosed that PT.

Rita Susilawati, Head of the Center for Groundwater and Environmental Geology (PATGTL) at the Geological Agency, said that the lowering of the groundwater level, which is in a delicate condition, is due to excessive water withdrawal.  Rita revealed, based on the Groundwater Conservation Map of the Bandung–Soreang Groundwater Basin (CAT) compiled by the Geological Agency in 2010, in the Cileunyi area and its surroundings there has been a decrease in the pressured groundwater level (deep groundwater or artesian) to around 60 meters below the ground surface. local.\nSo that the area, he continued, is a vulnerable area with a reduction rate of 40 percent to 60 percent from the initial condition. \"This phenomenon was seen in several places, including around the Cileunyi area to the Rancaekek area and its surroundings,\" he said via text message, Monday (6/2/2023). According to him, the Rancaekek area and its surroundings have a confined aquifer system (deep aquifer or artesian) at a depth of around 50 to 150 meters.\nThis area is hydrogeologically an area of ​​groundwater discharge from the Bandung–Soreang CAT. \"The pattern of depressed groundwater flow (deep groundwater) in the plains of Rancaekek and its surroundings indicates a conical phenomenon of lowering the groundwater level which indicates very intensive groundwater extraction,\" he said. In fact, he continued, the Rancaekek area has experienced a decrease in the depressed groundwater level (deep/artesian groundwater) to more than 70 meters below the local ground level. This causes the area to be an area prone to damage with a reduction rate of 40 percent to more than 80 percent from the initial condition. His party said that after 2010, the Geology Agency did not carry out monitoring of groundwater conditions in the Cileunyi and Rancaekek areas which were included in the Bandung-Soreang CAT. That authority, continued Rita, belongs to the government of West Java Province. \"Currently the authority to manage groundwater has changed to being based on river areas, and the Bandung area, which is included in the Citarum River area, becomes central authority, so that in 2023 the Geological Agency will again carry out groundwater monitoring activities in Bandung and its surroundings,\" he added. Water Conditions Rita added, the cause of the damaged groundwater conditions along Cileunyi to Rancaekek was due to excessive groundwater extraction in the area. Considering that there are many industrial buildings in the Rancaekek area , this does not rule out being the cause. However, continued Rita, it is necessary to further evaluate whether the industry is the cause of the decrease in the groundwater level in Cileunyi to Rancaekek. \"To find out whether the industry is the main cause, further evaluation is needed, because if the industry complies with the groundwater withdrawal regulations set forth in the permit, it should not cause problems,\" he said. His party highlighted the rampant illegal and unlicensed groundwater extraction. \"What must be paid attention to is illegal or unlicensed groundwater extraction which is still rife. Unlicensed drilled wells cannot control the discharge of groundwater pumping, so it has the potential to cause damage to groundwater conditions in an area,\" he concluded.", "Sources": "https://bandung.kompas.com/read/2023/02/06/114421178/muka-air-tanah-di-bandung-turun-hingga-60-persen-industri-diduga-jadi\nhttps://www.dwipapuri-abadi.com/siteplan.html" }, "geometry": { "type": "Point", "coordinates": [ 107.799664, -6.962019 ] } },

This problem could set a bad precedent for the city of Semarang if it is not addressed immediately. \"Next week, we will invite industrial area managers and business representatives to a meeting to find a solution,\" said Semarang City Acting Regional Secretary, Harini Krisniati, at Semarang City Hall, Tuesday (8/9). Entrepreneurs in the Terboyo Industrial Area complained about road damage and environmental pollution which disrupted their production activities. Harini admitted that this problem must be addressed immediately as part of the Semarang City Government's commitment to investment development. According to Harini, improving social facilities and public facilities should be the responsibility of the management, in this case PT Merdeka Wirastama. \"For this reason, the city government will urge the management to immediately improve the infrastructure.

They complained about the presence of toxic and hazardous waste (B3) pollution which allegedly came from the iron smelting factory owned by PT Power Steel Indonesia in the Millennium Industrial Area.\n\"In the morning or evening, the smoke from this iron smelting factory reaches my house. \"Sometimes the pollution is so frequent and widespread that we are affected to the point of coughing,\" said Hermansyah, a resident of Peusar Village to journalists, last weekend.\nAccording to him, the impact of B3 waste pollution from the iron smelting factory is very environmentally unfriendly, so it can cause the air conditions in residential areas to become unhealthy.\nApart from that, the pollution produced by factory activities is also detrimental to the health of residents and the surrounding environment because it is suspected to contain toxic and dangerous materials (B3).\n\"What makes us even more confused is that local government people know that this smelting factory is wrong, but they don't take any action,\" he said.\nAnother resident, Sutiyah (48), said that this air pollution condition had been occurring for several years. In fact, about three years ago residents demanded a meeting or mediation regarding the case of pollution at the iron smelting factory.\n\"We had a meeting before. And the company compensates residents for damages, only that only once. \"Now it's no longer there, the factory hasn't even improved its waste management,\" he said.\nMeanwhile, in a separate place, the Head of the Legal Development Section of the Tangerang Regency Environmental Cleanliness Service (DLHK), Sandi Nugraha, stated that from the results of checks and tests in the field, the company or steel smelting factory was found to have 10 smelting furnaces (furnaces) equipped with hoods which function to capture emissions. dust and smoke poured into the teapot (reservoir).\nHowever, dust or smoke emissions fly in the production area because the hood's ability to suck up dust does not operate normally. Thus, air pollution occurs which has a direct impact on the surrounding community.\n\"The situation becomes worse when strong winds blow (usually from midday to afternoon) which causes dust or smoke to reach the environment around the factory,\" he said.\nHe said, apart from finding negligence, the testing team from DLHK also found five emission chimney units that did not comply with the technical provisions of Kepdal No. 205 of 1996, namely sampling holes, chimney codes, coordinate points, and supporting facilities (ladders, safety fences, and platform).\n\"But at the time of our visit to the location the company was carrying out repairs on several chimneys,\" he said.\nNevertheless, he continued, with the discovery of several violations or negligence by the company, his party will continue to carry out supervision with a focus on monitoring improvements and improving air management resulting from production activities at the steel smelting factory.\nApart from that, his party also requires companies to periodically report environmental documents in accordance with existing/actual conditions every 6 (six) months to the Tangerang Regency DLHK or through the KLHK Environmental Electronic Reporting System (SIMPEL) portal.\n\"Companies are required to improve the performance of the hood, which functions to capture dust and smoke emissions that are poured into the jug (container) to minimize dust emissions or smoke flying in the production area and the environment around the factory,\" he said.\"", "Sources": "https://directorsdirectory.com/millennium-industrial-estate/\n(Archived link, 11/27/23) https://web.archive.org/web/20231127172956/https://kemenperin.go.id/kawasan\nhttp://bumicitrapermai.com/\n(Broken) https://bumicitrapermai.com/media/\nhttps://www.idx.co.id/StaticData/NewsAndAnnouncement/ANNOUNCEMENTSTOCK/From_EREP/201905/f9cfcd8374_a02ca855ab.pdf \nhttps://industri.kontan.co.id/news/bumi-citra-ingin-tambah-landbank-100-ha-di-cikupa \nhttps://www.multifab.co.id/news/29 \nhttps://wikimapia.org/11392462/Millennium-Industrial-Estate\nhttps://finance.detik.com/berita-ekonomi-bisnis/d-866417/pln-jamin-listrik-kawasan-industri-millenium-cikupa\nhttps://voi.id/en/news/322088\nhttps://bantenraya.co/pt-psm-dan-psi-diduga-lakukan-pencemaran-udara/" }, "geometry": { "type": "Point", "coordinates": [ 106.527825, -6.259628 ] } },

This is because the company that manages the Pasar Kemis industrial area, Tangerang, did not make financial reports or annual reports from 2008 to 2015.\nThis action is considered to be contrary to Law Number 40 of 2007 concerning Limited Liability Companies.

In fact, Siauly dares to insult Gunarko's credibility as a legal shareholder whose rights are protected by the company's Articles of Association,\" he stressed.\nBambang explained that Gunarko, as the holder of 17.36 percent of the shares, sued Siauly Papan and also sued Mutiara Papan, Mirawati Papan, who each own 17.36 percent of the shares and Dayakonsolindo Sumbersemesta as the holder of 30.56 percent of the shares of PT PDP.\n\"Because the co-defendants are considered to be protecting the Director of PT PDP Siauly Papan,\" he explained.\"\n\nEnvironmental Impact:\nIn 2023, claims that Pasar Kemis was the most polluted area in South East Asia went viral on social media based on monitoring by the IQAir website. The head of the Tangerand Regency Environment and Hygiene Service clarified that these measurements were from 2022, and not accurate for 2023. The head of Pasar Kemis District admitted that air pollution was a big problem for the area, given its dense population and industrial areas, and said it would take coordination between government ad business actors to minimize air pollution (news.republika.co.id, 4/13/2023).\n\n(Republik, 4/13/2023, news.republika.co.id): The Most Polluting Kemis Market in Southeast Asia, DLHK Tangerang: Data is Invalid\n\"Head of the Tangerang Regency Environment and Hygiene Service (DLHK), Achmad Taufik, claims that the status of air pollution in the Pasar Kemis area is not as bad as the information that has gone viral on social media (medsos). Based on monitoring of the IQAir website and application on Monday (10/04/2023) at 10:00 WIB, the air pollution status in the Pasar Kemis area was at moderate conditions (PM 2.5, namely 32.2 ug/m3 micro gram). \n\"This is different from the data uploaded on social media which named Pasar Kemis District, Tangerang Regency as the most polluted area in Southeast Asia,\" said Taufik in his statement received by Republika , Wednesday (12/4/2023).\nAccording to Taufik, the data that is widely uploaded on social media is old data, namely data for the period 2022. So, he continued, the data submitted by the reporter from social media Instagram is data from 2022 which is no longer valid.\nHe also clarified the data uploaded by seastats and seasia.co on his Instagram social media account, that Pasar Kemis District is the most polluted area in Southeast Asia in 2022 with a PM 2.5 particles value of 49.6.\nTaufik said that the ranking status of IQAir results at the Pasar Kemis location in Tangerang Regency was not on the top most polluted ranking list. He claimed that the Tangerang Regency Government through DLHK could create a comfortable and beautiful living environment.\n\"Thank God, this is something we need to be grateful for, as part of our joint efforts, it can be seen from the data that we have checked the system IQ results which are still below air quality standards,\" said Taufik.\nIn line with the statement of the Head of DLHK, Head of Pasar Kemis District, Sony Karsan, said that collaboration between various parties is needed to minimize air pollution in Pasar Kemis District.\nConsidering that the Pasar Kemis area is a densely populated area and also an industrial area in Tangerang Regency. Nevertheless, his party admits that the air pollution problem in the Pasar Kemis District area will take a long time to overcome. \n\"Given that from a geographical perspective this area is an industrial area and is densely populated, this is what causes pollution in the Pasar Kemis District area to be poor. Therefore cooperation and collaboration is needed from various parties,\" he said.\nHe also said that the Government continues to encourage efforts related to environmental problems in Pasar Kemis District, one of which is by providing education and giving advice to business actors and community members to plant trees in their respective environments.\n\"Currently we are also coordinating and communicating with the Tangerang Regency DLHK to provide education to business actors so that they can plant trees in their respective environments,\" he said.\nMeanwhile, for motor vehicle pollution, the government's efforts are being encouraged to carry out emissions tests on motor vehicles in certain areas, especially in the Pasar Kemis area.\"", "Sources": "https://manufakturindo.com/company/detail/pt-putera-daya-perkasa.html\nhttps://www.inilah.com/hakim-putuskan-direktur-pt-pdp-melawan-hukum\nhttps://portalinvestigasi.co/peran-aktif-pt-indo-surya-kencana-dalam-hal-perbaikan-infrastruktur-jalan-di-kawasan-industri/\nhttps://www.merdeka.com/uang/7-tahun-tak-buat-laporan-keuangan-bos-pt-pdp-didenda-rp-77-miliar.html\nhttps://tangerangnews.com/kabupaten-tangerang/read/33592/3-Tahun-Jalan-Kawasan-Industri-Pasar-Kemis-Dibiarkan-Rusak-Parah\nhttps://indoposco.id/megapolitan/2023/04/08/gudang-penyimpanan-benang-di-tangerang-terbakar\nhttps://news.republika.co.id/berita/rt0c8o330/pasar-kemis-paling-berpolusi-di-asia-tenggara-dlhk-tangerang-datanya-tidak-valid\n(Archived link, 11/27/23) https://web.archive.org/web/20231127172956/https://kemenperin.go.id/kawasan\n(Archived link, 11/28/23) https://web.archive.org/web/20231128184118/https://business-indonesia.org/data-estate" }, "geometry": { "type": "Point", "coordinates": [ 106.534518, -6.171968 ] } },

Muhara, Sunday (22/5/2022).\nSopian, the owner of the rice field, who is also a local resident, said that the water overflowed and inundated his parents' rice field as a result of the PT Irama Gemilang Lestari (IGL) industrial area construction project, resulting in landslides and narrowing of the Muhara river.\nOther rice field owners, Arumi and Budin, also felt the same thing. They admitted that they had been so badly affected that they were no longer able to grow crops due to flooding or overflowing waters of the Muhara River.\n\"The Muhara River, which used to be approximately 8 meters wide, has now shrunk to approximately 2 meters and due to heavy rain, the land around the industrial area collapsed and covered the river basin (DAS) so that the river water rose and flooded my parents' rice fields,\" complained Sopian. .\nSopian said that at the beginning of the construction of the industrial area, he had said that the river should be tidied up first, so that the residents' rice fields would not be flooded, but the developer ignored this.\n\"We hope that the government will be sensitive, because currently residents still need agricultural land as a source of income for residents,\" he explained.\nMeanwhile, Dudung, a youth leader from Cileles Village, claimed that the local government was not sensitive to the effects or impacts of the IGL industrial area project.

In a public hearing on Wednesday (15/3/2023), residents revealed that there was a practice of brokering in the land acquisition process so that they suffered losses.\nSayuti, one of the residents, said that as a result of this practice, he only received IDR 100 million in December 2020, for the down payment for the acquisition of his approximately 5,000 square meter land from PT Pancapuri Indoperkasa through Rusli, a broker. This value is far from the initially agreed price, namely IDR 1.49 billion.\n\"Even though I have never given any power of attorney to Rusli. \"That's why I keep asking what happens to the remaining payments,\" he said.\nIt was explained that after investigating it, it was later discovered that the management of PT Pancapuri Indoperkasa had paid off its obligations through Rusli's savings account, but unfortunately the amount was not as expected, namely only IDR 1.1 billion, which was suddenly rejected by Sayuti.\n“Yes, of course we don't want to. Moreover, there is already an agreement that if the completion process is later than 2020, the price will be adjusted, even though we are not discussing this issue. \"We only demand rights,\" he said.\nRusli was also present at the hearing. In his statement, he said that the emergence of the problem was triggered by pressure on repayment by Sayuti and the payment pattern which was paid in installments and bailed out by individual employees of PT Pancapuri Indoperkasa with certain considerations so that the value did not match what Sayuti expected.\n“After continuing to pay in installments for two years, finally I was confused. Because the family didn't want to accept it, they didn't want to return it to Pancapuri, so in the end the money was returned to me. \"Later, if the price is right, then I will give it to my family, this was my mistake at that time,\" said Rusli.\nFrom this brokering practice, Rusli explained that he received a wage of IDR 5 thousand per meter from PT Pancapuri Indoperkasa. Furthermore, he even admitted the truth regarding him not holding a power of attorney from Sayuti. This was because his role as a broker for around 50 other land owners had long been known to many residents, long before he had any dealings with Sayuti.\n“Essentially, I admit that I was wrong, and I fully understand the implications of the actions I have committed. In fact, from the start I told the family, if you want to report it to the police, you can. \"If it were me, I wouldn't be running anywhere, in fact it would be clear to see who is playing at Pancapuri,\" he explained.\nMeanwhile, the Chairman of Commission I of the Cilegon DPRD, Masduki, hopes that this issue will reveal the dark veil of the polemic about land acquisition for residents by PT Pancapuri Indoperkasa which has not yet been resolved.\n\"What's even more strange is why Pancapuri can go to him (transact with Rusli), even though he doesn't have a power of attorney. But this is one of the cases, it could be that the previous problem also had a model like this. Well, everything will be revealed as to who the land mafia is, including the 50 residents (facilitated by brokers) who actually need to be investigated, but that's not in our area. It's possible that the polemic that arose at Mount Sugih was because of casuistry like this. \"From Pancapuri, it was completed but not delivered,\" said Masduki.\nUnfortunately, the hearing which was attended by the Regional Financial and Asset Management Agency (BPKAD), the Head of the Legal Section of the Regional Secretariat of Cilegon City, the National Land Agency (BPN) of Cilegon City, Subdistricts and Districts was not also attended by the management of PT Pancapuri Indoperkasa.\n\"Even if Pancapuri cannot attend today without news and confirmation, we will invite him back later, and I will coordinate with the leadership,\" explained this PAN politician.\n\n(BantenNews, 9/22/2022, bantennews.co.id): PT Pancapuri Indoperkasa Regrets Blocking Project Access by Cilodan Residents\n\"Dozens of residents of the Cilodan Neighborhood RT 18/05 Gunung Sugih Village, Ciwandan District, Cilegon City on Thursday (22/9/2022) blocked an environmental road which has been the access for PT Pancapuri Indoperkasa's heavy vehicle mobility for the development project of PT Chandra Asri Petrochemical ( CAP) 2.\nThe residents had to carry out the action of blocking the road and unfurling a banner containing the demands because it was confirmed that PT Pancapuri Indoperkasa had not completed its obligation to acquire the land belonging to the residents.\n\"The road has been used by Pancapuri for the road project, while my extended family, around 20 of the houses above, have not been released, that doesn't include the families below. We are disturbed by the dust from the project,\" said Dani Adhani (63), a resident to BantenNews.co.id.\nAccording to Dani, his decision was unanimous regarding the acquisition value of approximately 3,000 square meters of land belonging to his family. However, the value offered has not yet received a response from PT Pancapuri Indoperkasa.\n“Those who come to us are all brokers, not A1, whose Pancapuri people are. If you are a broker, you know yourself. Meanwhile, if my family has clearly asked for the figure of Rp. 5 million per meter, and that's okay, it doesn't count as house buildings. That's why we are blocking it, so it's better to just close it first,\" he explained.\nAccording to Dani Adhani, the majority of local residents have left their homes after receiving payment for their release from PT Pancapuri Indoperkasa. \"All that's left here is my family, along with Haji Ismat's family, Sayani, the others have all been released,\" he said.\nUntil this news was released, the Director of PT Pancapuri Indoperkasa, Abraham Sinatrawan, confirmed via his cellphone that he had not responded to calls and WhatsApp messages sent by journalists.\"\n", "Sources": "https://www.bantennews.co.id/pt-pancapuri-indoperkasa-sesalkan-pemblokiran-akses-proyek-oleh-warga-cilodan/\nhttps://bantenhits.com/2015/08/27/warga-cilegon-tolak-pembangunan-kawasan-industri-pt-pancapuri-indoperkasa/  \nhttps://www.bantennews.co.id/lahan-belum-dibebaskan-warga-cilodan-blokir-jalan-pt-pancapuri-indoperkasa/\n(Archived link, 11/27/23) https://web.archive.org/web/20231127172956/https://kemenperin.go.id/kawasan\nhttps://kiec.co.id/id/2018/04/12/mou-pancapuri-cap/\nhttps://www.chandra-asri.com/\nhttps://www.shokubai.co.jp/en/company/nsi/\nhttps://www.shokubai.co.jp/en/company/history/\nhttps://www.cleanenergyministerial.org/content/uploads/2022/03/pt-nippon-indonesia.pdf\n" }, "geometry": { "type": "Point", "coordinates": [ 106.0253571, -5.995740374 ] } },

BORNEO ALUMINDO PRIMA and PT. KETAPANG BANGUN PRIMA which are companies incorporated in HANGZHOU JINJIANG GROUP CO., LTD which is based in the city of Lin'an, Zhejiang province, China.\nIn this project, HANGZHOU JINJIANG GROUP CO., LTD in the initial stage invested funds amounting to 1,250 million USD which was intended for the construction of an industrial area, an aluminum factory with a capacity of 4.5 million tons per year, the construction of a 15 x 25 MW PLTU and the construction of a special port.\nIt is planned that the aluminum industry which is managed by the company PT. BORNEO ALUMINDO PRIMA, whose raw material is bouxite, will be supplied by 9 companies including Pt. Tamindo Mutiara Perkasa, Pt. Fortuna Jaya Makmur, Pt. Kindai Mandiri Sejahtera 290, Pt. Kindai Mandiri Sejahtera 291, Pt. Agrabudi Gasutama Prima, Pt. Cakrawala Mandiri Sedaya, Pt. Tayan Alumina Abadi and Pt. Meliau Ratu Abadi with a total production plan of 10 million tons per year.\nThe construction that is currently being carried out is still at the land preparation stage, including land clearing work as well as filling and other initial construction work, but what is very unfortunate is that the supply of materials used for filling work is suspected to have been supplied from unofficial or illegal excavation sites. Based on research by national media OBORKEADILAN.COM, the mining location for the stockpiled material comes from behind the Miftaluh Ulum Islamic boarding school, Gayam hamlet, Sungai Gantang Village, Kendawangan District, where the location also belongs to the Islamic boarding school foundation.\nAccording to the confession of one of the administrators of the Miftaluh Ulum Islamic boarding school foundation, who did not want to be named, he said that \"the excavation does not have a mining permit nor does it have an environmental permit as it should, but the fees obtained from the sale of the laterite land will be used to build the development of the Islamic boarding school facilities.\" he said. \nMeanwhile, according to Ibrahim, Myh, who is the coordinator of the Nusantara Corruption Watch (NCW) for the West Kalimantan region, said that the laterite mining activity did not have a Mining Business Permit (IUP) in accordance with Law Number 4 of 2009 concerning Mineral and Coal Mining (Minerba) as well. Government Regulation (PP) Number 23 of 2010 concerning the Implementation of Mineral and Coal Mining Business Activities, along with Law Number 28 of 2009 concerning Taxes and Levies and what is no less important is the existence of an environmental permit from the Kendawangan district government or the West Kalimantan Regency Government, however \"None of these things are owned by the excavation manager,\" he said irritably.\nMonitoring in the field of excavation activities using excavator type heavy equipment and transported by dozens of dump truck type vehicles going back and forth to the landfill site via public roads which created dust and no watering activities were carried out by the management of excavation C. According to several residents, the excavation was coordinated by someone named Mr. Deril alias Maxklem alias Mc lean D. Meray is suspected of being a thug and is the third hand in collecting PT. BORNEO ALUMINDO PRIMA's laterite excavation.\nAt a different time, in the room of the Ketapang Police Chief, AKBP Yuri Nurhidayat, when confirmed by several media crew regarding the existence of mining activities that did not have legality, in one statement he said, \"You need to know that the issue of permitting Excavation C in our area is very complicated and takes a long time. In the Kendawangan area and its surroundings, there are no business entities or individuals who have a C mining business permit that have received a production permit. I have raised this issue at the Forkopimda meeting. \"C mining/excavation activities may not have a permit as long as they are not supplied outside the area or are not bought and sold outside the area and the issue of controlling mining that does not have a permit is the authority of the local government through Satpol PP,\" he said. \nUntil the time this news was published, excavation activities supplied to industrial and port construction sites managed by PT BORNEO ALUMINDO PRIMA were still ongoing even though the materials used were sourced from excavations that did not have clear legality in accordance with the provisions of Government Regulation No. 1 of 2014 regarding the second amendment to PP no. 23 of 2010 concerning the implementation of mineral and coal mining business activities, Law Number 4 of 2009 concerning Mineral and Coal Mining (State Gazette of the Republic of Indonesia of 2009 Number 4, Supplement to the State Gazette of the Republic of Indonesia Number 49), Law Number 32 of 2009 concerning Environmental Protection and Management (State Gazette of the Republic of Indonesia of 2009 Number 140, Supplement to the State Gazette of the Republic of Indonesia Number 5059).\"", "Sources": "https://kargoku.id/kawasan-industri-terpadu-ketapang/\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QX6b1yiXhSM\nhttps://ecc.co.id/company/site/view/2038\nhttps://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1755-1315/1109/1/012037/pdf\n(Archived link, 11/27/23) https://web.archive.org/web/20231127172956/https://kemenperin.go.id/kawasan\nhttps://regionalinvestment.bkpm.go.id/pir/peluang-investasi/detail/?id=1134\nhttps://perusahaan.net/detail/wVy0w/Borneo-Alumindo-Prima/\nhttps://pontianak.tribunnews.com/2016/12/28/inilah-penjelasan-bpmptsp-kalbar-terkait-kawasan-industri-ketapang\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=isp-IudXlx8\n(Archived link, 6/12/2024) https://web.archive.org/web/20240612174321/https://www.sinarrayanews.com/diduga-keras-bisa-merugikan-negara-milyaran-rupiah-status-izinnya-belum-pemulihan-pasca-dicabut-pt-bmp-dan-cv-kqp-jual-tanah-urug-ke-pt-kbs/ \nhttps://www.oborkeadilan.com/2018/12/pembangunan-proyek-kawasan-industri-dan.html " }, "geometry": { "type": "Point", "coordinates": [ 110.1069565, -2.242999437 ] } },

PT ATI had submitted relevant documents, but the council was still waiting on documents from PT Mega Nur, which as of 2020 was not operational. PT Mega Nur claimed that PT. ATI failed to ask permission before undertaking construction that hindered the activities of PT. Mega Nur on its 20 ha. Separately, the surrounding community expressed it's desire to hand over PT. Mega Nur's land to PT. ATI, since PT.

Even the encroachment of mangrove forests (mangroves) and seagrass beds (lelamo) poses a real threat to Sambalagi Village due to natural disasters.\n\"In fact, in several areas, mangroves and lelamo are also protected and President Joko Widodo has often called for them to be protected together for the benefit of the community. \"Therefore, it would not be wrong if the people of Sambalagi Village asked PT Anugrah Tambang Industri to conduct socialization regarding plans for industrial area development activities in collaboration with PT Vale Indonesia,\" he said.\nHe explained that in July 2022, the Sambalagi Village Government had sent a letter to the leadership of PT Anugrah Tambang Industri regarding the request for this socialization. However, in various meetings held, the leadership of PT ATI and the Sambalagi Village aparta only made promises.\n\"In fact, we held a public consultation at the Lafeu Village Office, a sub-district location which was attended by the Regent of Morowali and the Head of Bungku Pesisir Sub-District. \"I don't know whether they want to move the planned smelter factory to that village, or it's a speculative effort carried out by PT ATI,\" he said.\nFor this and with patience, he added the Sambalagi Village Government. Then, he sent a second letter on January 6 2023, with the same request, namely urging PT ATI to socialize the community.\nHowever, the Head of the Public Relations Department of PT Anugrah Tambang Industri, Margono alias Ahong, replied to the Sambalagi Village Government's letter which disappointed the Sambalagi community.\nThe contents of the letter are for the Sambalagi Village Government to write to the Regent of Morowali to facilitate requests for community outreach to PT Anugrah Tambang Industri. This is impressive, because the Regent of Morowali was the facilitator of this socialization activity.\n\"As far as we know, socialization is a necessity that must be carried out by every company when they want to carry out activities in the village,\" he explained.\nHe added that socialization also makes local people know and understand what will be built or erected in the village. So that society can face the impacts that will occur.\n\"Because of this, we, the people of Sambalag Village, have asked PT Anugrah Tambang Industri to temporarily stop mountain demolition activities before carrying out outreach to the Sambalag Village community,\" he stressed.\n\"And the Morowali Regional People's Representative Council (DPRD) will immediately hold a\nhearing meeting by inviting the people of Sambalagi Village regarding the\nencroachment of mangrove forests and seagrass beds in Sambalagi Village,\" he said.\n\nEnvironmental Impact:\nPotential destruction of mangroves\nedisiindonesia.id, 1/17/2023: Sambalagi Community Asks PT Anugrah Tambang Industri to Stop Activities\nThe people of Sambalagi Village, Bungku Pesisir District, Morowali Regency asked PT Anugrah Tambang Industri (ATI) to temporarily stop its activities.\nAccording to the Sambalagi Community Coordinator, Irfan Mualim, PT ATI's presence in Sambalagi Village is expected to have a positive impact, not only on improving the economy of the local community.\n\"However, the economic impact has never been seen, only the impact of pollution and the noise that exists after the demolition of several mountains in Sambalagi Village,\" said Irfan Mualim, in his written statement, Tuesday (17/1/2023).\nFurthermore, he said, heavy equipment continues to roar non-stop 1 x 24 hours, disrupting people's sleep.

This action sparked a reaction of resistance from opposing labor groups. As a result, clashes were inevitable.\nHundreds of police officers intervened to mediate between the two warring camps.\nThe workers' strike action was to urge the management of PT VDNI and PT OSS to provide family allowances, transportation allowances and housing allowances to workers. The workers also asked the company to carry out Collective Labor Agreement (PKB) negotiation procedures in accordance with Minister of Manpower Regulation (Permenaker) No. 28 of 2014, and urged the central management leadership to remove the HRD position of PT. OSS and PT. VDNI in Morosi.\nFor your information, these two nickel refining companies, PT VDNI and PT OSS, are located in the Morosi industrial area. PT VDNI was founded in 2014 and is a subsidiary of De Long Nickel Co Ltd which originates from Jiangsu, China. This company invested tens of trillions of rupiah to build a smelter facility with modern technology. Its production capacity is 600,000-800,000 tons of nickel pig iron per year. Until the end of 2018, PT VDNI had contributed US$142.2 million to Indonesian exports.\nThe parent companies of PT OSS are Hong Kong Xiangyu Hansheng Co Ltd and Singapore Xiangyu Hansheng Pte Ltd. This company was founded in 2016 in an area of ​​398 hectares with an investment value of US$ 2 billion. Since 2018, this company has applied for a principle permit to build a 400,000 ton stainless steel production facility, 800,000 ton steel lab and 800,000 ton ferronickel. To date, PT OSS has built 17 smelter furnaces out of the planned 30 furnaces.\nMeanwhile, Arys Nirwana, Head of Human Resources Department PT VDNI and PT OSS, in his release explained that what was conveyed by the action participants did not match the facts. This is because, for example, the company has good intentions and is open to discussing this matter as long as the labor union fulfills the requirements in accordance with applicable laws and regulations.\nIn every meeting held at the company, at the Konawe Regency Manpower Office and the Provincial DPRD Hearing Meeting, the company complied with the summons and acted cooperatively.\nFor wage demands, the company's payroll system refers to statutory regulations and company regulations/policies.

The actions of the trade unions which use this as a reason for the strike are baseless.\n\"In the previously circulated action circular, the things conveyed in the notification letter are untrue, unfounded, and tend to provoke and disturb company employees who intend to work seriously to support their families and to develop their abilities and competencies. as well as professionalism in work,\" he explained. (AT Network)\nEnvironmental Justice Atlas, 4/10/2022: \"Residents that live close to Delong Nickel Smelter began to complain about the pollution from coal dust after the coal-fired power plants began operation [7]. These involve at least 6 villages:  Sama Subur, Wawoluri, Puuwonggia, Ranombopulu, Motui and Lambuluo. It was reported that the coal dust regularly blows up to 3 kilometers away from the power station and affects households both indoors and outdoors [7]. Children in the area began coughing and having respiratory problems [7].  A written complaint signed by 15 village heads was submitted to PT Obsidian Stainless Steel (OSS) [7].

A protest involved 800 workers calling for higher salaries and better working conditions e.g. permanent employment for contractors. When management refused to meet with the protestors, the demonstrators began destroying company property. Significant damage was inflicted up on the nickel production facilities, and about 40 pieces of heavy equipment were set on fire and destroyed[3], [4], [8].\"\n\n(Ungku & Christina, 12/16/2020, reuters.com): \"Violent protests by hundreds of workers at one of Indonesia’s biggest nickel smelters on Sulawesi island operated by PT Virtue Dragon Nickel Industry (PT VDNI) had “paralysed” its activities, the China-backed company said in a statement.\nThe protest, which saw 800 workers calling for higher salaries and permanent employment for contractors, turned violent on Monday, as workers torched vehicles and buildings.\n“The rioting resulted in company activities being paralysed because the factory supporting equipment was badly damaged and about 40 heavy equipment and operational vehicles belonging to the company caught fire,” PT VDNI, a unit of China’s Jiangsu Delong Nickel Industry, said in a statement late on Tuesday.\" \n\nEnvironmental Impact:\nSmoke and coal dust from power plant resulting in respiratory problems, contaminated water hurting local fish supply, mud flooding during wet season, trash accumulation\n\n(Pulitzer Center, 1/23/2023, pulitzercenter.org): \"... When Virtue Dragon Nickel Industry built the smelter there eight years ago, people from around Morosi went there hoping to make money. Economic opportunities grew when Obsidian Stainless Steel officially opened a nickel smelter last year. The two companies are subsidiaries of Xiangyu and the Delong Group, a Chinese business alliance. Obsidian has a production capacity of over 2.5 million tons of nickel per year. Virtue Dragon has a production capacity of over 1 million tons annually. Those two factories produce nickel pig iron (NPI), ferronickel, and nickel matte. Those three nickel ore products are components for making steel. As of the third quarter of 2021, Obsidian exported over 800,000 tons of NPI worth Rp24.5 trillion. Virtue Dragon exported 618,117 metric tons worth Rp17 trillion over that same period. In addition to stimulating the economy outside the factory gates, those two large smelters provide a lot of jobs. La Ode Muhammad Alihaswandy, Chief of the Office of Transmigration and Labor of Southeast Sulawesi, said that out of 25,281 workers at those two smelters, 1,893 are from China. “The mining sector accounts for 2.9 percent of workers,” he said. According to Alihaswandy, the opening of shops is but one domino effect from the construction of nickel smelters in Morosi. Residents rent out boarding rooms or houses, open restaurants, workshops, and other commercial facilities. Newly built shops sprouted up along the road in Morosi... The growth in economy in Southeast Sulawesi due to this nickel mining activity has created a new problem: trash accumulation. In addition to the high amount of street dust and smoke resulting from the burning of coal to power the ore processing plant, trash scatters on the streets around the market or vendor shops, and is even found in the river and swamps. It appears that the local government has not made any plans in response to the impact of this sudden economic change. While most of the vendors come from outside of Morosi, locals tend to become factory workers or work side jobs in addition to their company jobs. Residents of Mandiodo, Tapuemea, and Tapunggaya villages no longer work as fishermen. They have gone to work in the factories or have taken up nickel mining. According to Ratna Kasim, head of neighborhood unit (RT) 4 in Tapunggaya village, of the 32 heads of households in her area only two still remain as fishermen. Her husband is paid Rp3 million a month as a security guard for heavy machinery located at the mining location. “Everything has grown with nickel,” she said, pointing to the houses with cars in the garages. Before the nickel mining, houses in her neighborhood had wood walls and sago palm frond roofing. Nearly no one can endure to work as fisherman in the villages located around the nickel mining location. Ratna said that the waters are contaminated with nickel slurry. Fishing platforms are often destroyed when barges in Tapunggaya Bay crash into them. As a result, fishers must search for daily catch further out at sea, making it more expensive to sail. “It is difficult to find fish now,” she said. Amirudin is one of two heads of households in RT 4 in Tapunggaya who remains to be a fisherman. He confirmed Ratna’s story. According to him, fish catches have been getting smaller since nickel mining started. Sometimes he catches 10 kilograms of fish a night, which are sold in the market for Rp200,000. “Before the nickel mining, my income was Rp600,000 a night,” he said. This is also the case in Mandiodo village. Slamet Riadi, the local village head, said that of the 239 heads of households in his area, perhaps only about 10 percent are still fishermen. Slamet explained that in addition to having difficulty catching fish, working in the factory is more promising. “It used to be easy to catch fish and difficult to sell them. Now it is easy to sell them but you have to go far out to catch them,” he said. In addition to earning wages working at the nickel smelter, residents in villages receive compensation from each company for the dust issue. In Mandiodo village, said Slamet, each family receives Rp1.5 million in compensation per month. This was an agreement reached between local communities and the company. According to him, the air became polluted after the nickel smelter went into operation, and conditions are particularly bad during the dry season. However, during the rainy season the dust dissipates but Mandiodo is inundated by mud, something which had never previously occurred in this village. In early December 2022, the entire Mandiodo village was inundated with mud mid-calf deep. According to Slamet, the mud ran down from the hills around Mandiodo that have become barren due to nickel mining. “Nickel gives life to the economy, but it destroys the environment,” he said.\"\n\n(Environmental Justice Atlas, 4/10/2022, ejatlas.org/conflict): \"Residents that live close to Delong Nickel Smelter began to complain about the pollution from coal dust after the coal-fired power plants began operation [7].

It is perceived by local workers that the Chinese peers tend to given higher wages and some of the Chinese workers were hired illegally, which led to anti-Chinese sentiments and even conflicts from time to time [32]. There were alleged labor malpractices such as termination of contracts, long working hours, unfair wages, and restrictions due to COVID-19, as well as high incident and fatality rate [7], [32], [33]. In a most recent case, “leading activists of the United Labour and People’s Alliance, which consists of three labor unions, the Morowali Industrial Workers Union (SPIM), the Morowali Indonesian Prosperous Labour Union (SBSI), and the Morowali Indonesian National Federation of Workers’ Unions (FSPNI), were dismissed unilaterally on 14 August 2020 by the management of the company due to their union activity in the pandemic time [34].” This incident started from a series of interactions between the Alliance and the company at the beginning of the Covid-19 pandemic, where 2,000 workers were sent home or told to quarantine. On 5 August 2020, the Alliance held a demonstration in front of the IMIP office, which led to a mediation meeting between the Alliance and the IMIP coordinated by the government through the Bahodopi sub-district secretary (Sekcam). On 14 August, three union leaders joined a meeting with the management of PT Indonesia Tsingshan Stainless Steel (ITSS) and PT Bukit Smelter Indonesia (BSI), which ended up with a unilateral dismissal of the three union leaders in the name of provoking colleagues to hold demonstrations and disrupting/hindering production.

In 2019, there was a massive flood that hit the Bahodopi area. In September 2019, hundreds of residents took to the streets in Dampala Village in the Bahodopip district, about 7 kilometers away from the IMIP, as a result of the lack of satisfying response from mining companies after the flood that hit the three villages of Dampala, Le Le and Siumbatu on 8 June 2019 [28]. The flood disaster claimed the lives of two residents and hundreds of houses, as well as public facilities. Residents that are members of the Aliansi Rakyat Menggugat (Armet) claimed that the cause of the flood was related to the nickel mining activities upstream of the village, and demanded a review of the environmental impact assessment (Amdal) document of PT Bintang Delapan Mineral (BDM) and revoking the company of its mining business license (MBL) [21]. It was reported that the flood did not affect the operation of the IMIP, but cut off some workers from their workplace due to the collapse of bridges and road. The Morowali Police Chief ended up coordinating the negotiation between the protesters and the local government, who promised to compensate the local residents for their loss and evaluate the MBL holders such as BDM [18], [28]. In November and December 2021, demonstrations were held by student group Aliansi Mahasiswa dan Masyarakat Morowali (AMMM) and consumer group Aliansi Pelanggan Listrik Menggugat (Pelita) Morowali respectively to request for solving the local electricity crisis, as local residents suffered from frequent blackouts.[29] While the demonstration was more targeting the local government and electricity provider PLN, the electricity shortage at the local communities is in direct contrast with the scale of coal-fired power plants built by the IMIP that provides electricity supply to its industrial operations. In fact, the IMIP allocated most of its corporate social responsibility (CSR) budget to electricity subsidies to address the community electricity shortage in the Bahodopi district, including Fatufia, Keurea, Bahodopi and Bahomakmur villages [30]. It was reported that the construction of the CFPP at the IMIP helped with the electricity access in the area, especially with the subsidies from the company. However, PLN did not continue the collaboration with the IMIP and used diesel power instead [31].\"\n\nEnvironmental Impact:\nDeforestation, water pollution, damage to local farms, respiratory infections\n(Environmental Justice Atlas, 7/5/2022, ejatlas.org/conflict ): \"The Bahodopi district is home to 12 villages, including 4 villages most directly affected by the IMIP, namely Bahodopi, Keurea, Fatufia and Bahomakmur [9]. Local NGOs such as AEER, JATAM and Yayasan Tanah Merdeka (YTM) have been raising the issues regarding the environmental and social impact of the IMIP, including the nickel mining activities and the CFPPs [20]. An academic article also documented different forms of conflicts involving various stakeholders in the nickel mining area in and around the IMIP based on interviews and questionnaires, especially the conflicts between migrant communities and local residents, and between local residents and companies [9]. The often mentioned impacts include the degradation of forests, rivers and coastal zones in the neighborhood, the impact on local farmers’ livelihood, and the health impact on the local residents [18]. It was reported that acute respiratory infection (ARI) is a common issue for local residents, including kids, in the Bahodopi district [18], [21]. While the companies claimed that they have used electrostatic precipitators at CFPPs and kilns to collect coal ash and some companies also used nets to filter coal ash, it appeared to be ineffective according to local residents’ complaints [18].\n\nConcern over deep sea tailings disposal, plan ultimately withdrawn:\n(Reuters, 10/2/2020, www.reuters.com ): \"Indonesia says battery-grade nickel project drops deep-sea waste plan\"\nAn Indonesian nickel smelting project being built by China’s Tsingshan Group and partner companies to produce battery-grade chemicals has withdrawn a request to dispose of waste in the ocean, a government official said on Friday.\nPT Hua Pioneer Indonesia, the company that requested the deep-sea tailing approval on behalf of the project had cancelled its request, Nani Hendiarti, an official at the Coordinating Ministry for Maritime Affairs and Investment, told Reuters.\n“Their main consideration was the complexity of the impact of sea tailing,” said Nani, who is deputy of Environment and Forestry Coordination at the ministry. “They are now seeking other technological options.”\"", "Sources": "https://ejatlas.org/conflict/indonesia-morowali-industrial-park-imip1\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morowali_Industrial_Park#cite_note-15\nhttps://www.gem.wiki/Sulawesi_Mining_power_station\nhttps://www.gem.wiki/Sulawesi_Labota_power_station\n(Broken) https://www.nickelmagazine.com/2022/04/smelter-industrial-area.html?m=1\nhttps://www.rosalux.de/fileadmin/images/publikationen/Studien/Fast_and_Furious_for_Future.pdf\nhttps://www.rosalux.de/en/publication/id/44155/fast-and-furious-for-future\nhttps://asiatimes.com/2023/01/chinas-labor-practices-under-hot-fire-in-indonesia/\nhttps://www.reuters.com/article/us-indonesia-nickel-environment-idUSKBN26N1VZ\nhttps://www.scmp.com/week-asia/people/article/3212109/indonesias-nickel-sector-under-scrutiny-chinese-workers-allege-inhumane-working-conditions\"\nhttps://thepeoplesmap.net/project/indonesia-morowali-industrial-park-imip/\nhttps://chinadialogue.net/en/energy/chinas-no-overseas-coal-power-pledge-15-projects-cancelled/\n(Archived link, 11/27/23) https://web.archive.org/web/20231127172956/https://kemenperin.go.id/kawasan\n(Archived link, 11/28/23) https://web.archive.org/web/20231128184118/https://business-indonesia.org/data-estate\n(Archived link, 5/29/24) https://web.archive.org/web/20240529165334/https://imip.co.id/\nhttps://www.reuters.com/article/china-gem-nickel-indonesia-idUKL1N3780PR/\nhttps://en.antaranews.com/news/285885/government-devising-development-plan-for-morowali-industrial-area\nhttps://industri.kontan.co.id/news/tak-lagi-tambah-tenant-ini-penjelasan-ceo-indonesia-morowali-industrial-park-imip\nhttps://indonesiabusinesspost.com/risks-opportunities/sesna-group-open-collaboration-to-develop-200-mw-solar-farm-for-nickel-mining-industry/\n(Archived link, 5/18/2024) https://web.archive.org/web/20240518022508/https://www.energytransitionpartnership.org/uploads/2022/09/The-Electricity-Infrastructure-Planning-and-Investment-Needs-to-Support-Energy-Transition.pdf" }, "geometry": { "type": "Point", "coordinates": [ 122.1619121, -2.830375288 ] } },

As of January 2023, JATAM found that 10 workers have died at Gunbuster Nickel Industry's area at the industrial park since it started operations.\n\n(Jatam, 1/28/2023, jatam.org): The Arrogance of PT GNI and the Network of Vested Interests of the Political Elite behind the Clashes in North Morowali\n\"The recent clashes between Chinese and Indonesian workers at the PT GNI smelter factory area were not only triggered by disagreement between Indonesian and foreign workers. The clash was the accumulation of a series of government policies and regulations trying to please the industry while ignoring a myriad of corporate crimes against workers, affected communities, and the environment.\nPT GNI is a Chinese company that started building a smelter and coal fired power plant in 2018 in Bunta in Central Sulawesi. The inauguration took place in Konawe in Southeast Sulawesi at an industrial park from the same owner, Tony Zhou Yuna, in presence of President Jokowi accompanied by a number of Ministers and Regional leaders on 27 December 2021.\nAt the inauguration, Jokowi emphasized that the local Governor and Regent should maintain ‘a conducive investment climate, so that there would be absorption of labor, foreign exchange and taxes’.\nThis includes keeping a strict law and order status in the area. It is not surprising that after the clashes at GNI, Jokowi’s only immediately response was instructing the National Police Chief to take firm action against the rioters. In no time, the police arrested dozens of Indonesian workers who were accused of being the perpetrators, but all officials are turning a blind eye to the problems that caused the clashes.\nThis shows the true character of the government and the law enforcement model of the police: it is more important to protect investments, rather than the take care of the safety of the people, protect the environment, as well as the welfare of the workers themselves.\nPT GNI’s Arrogance\nEven before PT Gunbuster Nickel Industry (PT GNI) was inaugurated by Jokowi, the operations of this  Chinese company had caused a number of environmental and humanitarian crimes. JATAM found that the company has a bad reputation when if comes to environmental and humanitarian crimes including its arrogance towards workers...\n[4] Based on information from a number of workers, 10 workers have died since PT GNI started its operations. The first victim, with the initials HR, died on June 3, 2020 after he got buried by an excavator. His body was only discovered two days after the incident.\nIn May and June 2022, 2 foreign workers committed suicide.  Their initials are MG and WR.\nThere were other heartbreaking stories. YSR was swept away by an avalanche while operating the bulldozer without lights and sank into the sea at a depth of 26 meters. AF lost his life while working in the smelter. He was found lifeless after falling next to the control board of a hydraulic machine.\nNS and MD are the two victims of a smelter furnace explosion on December 22, 2022. NS was a TikTok celebrity who went viral after he regularly posted his activities as a crane operator.\nOn January 14, 2023, the clash at PT GNI area resulted in 3 deaths; two Indonesian worker and a Chinese worker, and several injured.\n[5] Based on the statements of a number of workers, the company also cut various benefits that are workers’ rights, as well as creating and maintaining wage gaps and worker facilities between Indonesian and non-Indonesian workers, even if they do the same type of work.\nFor example, Chinese workers are getting salaries and additional facilities that are higher than the majority of domestic workers. This gap is also reflected in the colour of the helmets: white and red helmets for Chinese workers, and yellow helmets for the Indonesian workers. The managers are wearing white helmets, the supervisors a red one, and the yellow helmet are for the ‘crew’.\nMost Chinese workers are in commanding positions and are giving orders to Indonesian workers. Few Chinese workers are speaking Indonesian, they give their instructions in Mandarin and are often not understood. This often frustrated Chinese workers, with start yelling which in their tun offends Indonesian workers. This unhealthy work atmosphere has not been dealt with for years...\nThe Network of Actors behind PT GNI\nTony Zhou Yuan, the director of PT GNI, also serves as director of two other nickel smelter companies in Southeast Sulawesi, namely PT Virtue Dragon Nickel Industry (VDNI) and PT Obsidian Stainless Steel (OSS).\nAccording to JATAM’s records, PT VDNI reported and criminalized 12 workers who took action and clashed with company security officers.\nMeanwhile, PT OSS reportedly polluted the air in six villages with coal dust and polluted air from the company’s coal power plants which are only hundreds of meters away from the residents’ settlements. The residents’ activities were disrupted, their eyes turned red when exposed to the pollution and often cough and have difficulty breathing.\nTony Zhou Yuan has a close relationship with Ali Mazi, the governor of Southeast Sulawesi. Ali Mazi is known to be on the supervisory board of Tony Zhou Yuan’s Foundation, the Andrew & Tony Foundation.\nIn JATAM’s view, the clashes between workers at PT GNI, the track record of the Chinese company, as well as the government’s response and legal approach from the security forces are a concrete example of how the interests of business people and the ruling political elite in Indonesia are strengthening.\nJATAM believes that both the Indonesian and non-Indonesian workers are victims of this collusion. The government and security forces are actually framing a story in which they are scapegoating the Chinese staff, in order to avoid the unjust reality of a structural conflict.\"\n\nLand acquisition issues:\n(Project Multatuli,  05/07/2023, projectmultatuli.org/): \"...Wahono has rice fields and oil palm plantations. Rice fields covering an area of ​​1 ha, oil palm plantations covering an area of ​​4 ha. Both are now no longer productive because the water never recedes.\nThe oil palm plantation is included in the PT GNI area. Apart from Wahono, there are around 37 ha of transmigrant land that is included in the industrial area. On average, residents have 2 ha of land. There are some who have 1 ha, there are also 6 ha.\nTheir land is now part of a \"national vital object\". Access for residents is difficult. The gates of PT GNI are closely guarded by security forces, from company security officers, police, to soldiers.\nResidents asked for compensation, including Wahono. However, PT GNI appreciates it with a land acquisition value of IDR 15 thousand/m² or IDR 150 million/ha. In fact, in 2019, the release price was IDR 2,500/m² or IDR 25 million/ha.\nWahono objected to the price.\nHe set the price of his land at IDR 50 thousand/m² or IDR 500 million/ha, taking into account that PT GNI sunk his oil palm plantations. But, the company refused.\n“But, their tricks are good. They drowned [the palm trees]. \"Finally, it became unproductive land,\" complained Wahono.\nWahono offered a middle way: asking PT GNI to help residents whose rice fields and gardens were sinking by converting them into ponds.\nPT GNI can lend tools and fuel to raise the embankments, providing a path for fish to descend to the empang. That way, said Wahono, society also has economic movement.\nHowever, the company ignored this proposal.\nWahono couldn't stay silent. Land as a source of livelihood for his family is a matter of life and death. And, as transmigrants, their land is limited.\nWahono tried to find another way. To get the company's attention, he closed the road in front of his house, the road used by PT GNI for motorized vehicles going in and out of the company.\nHowever, instead of listening to residents' complaints, PT GNI sent security forces to their homes. Police and soldiers came and opened the way. Wahono couldn't move.\nFinally, Wahono took the initiative to make a new excavation so that the river could flow. After complaining to the regent's office, DPRD and local police, the government lobbied PT GNI to allow Wahono to borrow tools to dig.\nWahono worked on it for two months.\nAnd, it's proven. Since the excavation, the ground surface has become dry again.\nHowever, after only two weeks, the river route was closed again by PT GNI.\n\"Because what I passed was a hauling road,\" said Wahono. \"I want to build a bridge. If they run out of water, please close. If they are excessive, open them. So that we can live together. But, no. They just closed.”\nWahono complained to the Governor of Central Sulawesi, Rusdy Mastura. Rusdy ordered his staff to go to the field.\nThe company's response was to raise the land surface of residential areas. The digging of a new river route was never granted. The house didn't sink anymore, but the puddle never disappeared.\nWahono's oil palm plantations and rice fields remain depleted.\"\n\nEnvironmental Impact:\nPT. GNI/PT.

Unfortunately, the process of building and working on the PLTU dammed the Lampi River at that location without the knowledge of residents and land owners around the river. Walhi Central Sulawesi predicts that when the intensity of rain is high, the Lampi River water will definitely overflow and could submerge rice fields and residential areas of local residents.\n\"The air in hamlet 5 of Bunta Village is allegedly filled with sulfur dioxide gas (So2), which is a poisonous gas resulting from burning coal from the Captive Power Plant,\" said Sunardi Katili, Regional Executive Director of Walhi, Central Sulawesi during a press conference on Monday, June 12.\nNot only that, the construction of a jetty in Tanauge Village, Petasia District to serve as an entry point for the mobilization of coal supplies since early 2023, is alleged to have taken 65 hectares of residents' land without any compensation process. Sunardi said that the majority of the people who work as fishermen at that location are also suffering due to the operation of the Captive PLTU.\n\"The massive mobilization of coal-laden barges for the needs of the Captive PLTU at that location has had a big impact on the economic and social life of fishermen around that location. \"In fact, some people have stopped fishing because coal often spills, plus strict security by the Air and Water Police has become a frightening threat for fishermen looking for fish again,\" explained Sunardi Katili.\nCurrently, PT. GNI has built 3 Captive coal PLTU units in Tanauge Village with a capacity of 300 MW which is only approximately 500 meters from residential areas. As a result, said Sunardi, residents around the PLTU have to clean their houses every day, close doors and windows to avoid black dust from PT's burning coal. GNI.\"\n\n(Project Multatuli,  05/07/2023, projectmultatuli.org/): \"SINCE PT Gunbuster Nickel Industry (GNI) operated a smelter factory, Wahono and his family complained that the heat of the sun was no longer friendly. At the same time, the surface of the land around his house in Bunta Village, North Morowali, never dries out.\nThe plants lined up in front of the stilt house looked dry and covered in dust. The PT GNI industrial area is located about 10 km from his house. Dust from the factory flies around and sticks to the plants.\nUnder the house on stilts, black-brown water pooled and wet household utensils. The stagnant water smells and makes you itchy, said Wahono, who lives with his wife and three children, the youngest 6 months old, and his in-laws.\nPT GNI needs water as a coolant for coal power plants to meet the needs of nickel processing and refining facilities ( smelters ) in the area. The company takes water from the Koro Lamoito river—residents usually call it the Lampi River—by blocking the residents' river flow. As a result, river water overflowed into residential areas and flooded roads.\nTo overcome this, Wahono raised the ground surface of the house and around the house with sand and stones. The plan is that he will build a boarding house on the land next to his house.\nWahono is a transmigrant from Ponorogo, East Java, whose parents brought him in when he was 17 years old in 1996. The New Order government provided 1 ha of land for the transmigrants to work on rice fields. In total, there were 132 families from Java who took part in the transmigration program. Wahono remembers that the army was closely monitoring the process of farmers planting rice fields.\nHowever, the Indonesian government also rolled out the red carpet for two corporations coming to North Morowali, which are slowly evicting the transmigrants' land.\nThe first company was the palm oil plantation PT Agro Nusa Abadi (ANA), a subsidiary of PT Astra Agro Lestari Group, which arrived in 2006. Thirteen years later it was PT GNI.\n\"Companies should come and bring goodness to the community,\" said Wahono.\nWhat happened was just the opposite. Companies come to steal people's land. The company also caused environmental changes, making it impossible for residents to grow crops, residents alleged.\nIn the past, Wahono rice fields used to harvest twice a year. After PT ANA arrived, this company was accused of embanking the rice field planting areas, causing flooding of rice fields and residential areas. Wahono can only harvest rice once a year during the dry season.\nThen, when PT GNI closed the river flow, the water overflowed even more. Both the dry season and the rainy season, the land is submerged. Wahono couldn't harvest at all.\nIt felt, for Wahono, like being pranked by the state. \"I also know that [investment] is between countries,\" said Wahono, referring to PT GNI. “But we are the hosts. No matter how small we are.”\n'To and fro the water'\nThe main road in Bunta Village is the route for PT GNI workers' motorized vehicles and trucks entering and exiting the company. The road is now full of holes. Every time it rains heavily, the holes are flooded. Part of the ground surface of the house on the side of the road was also submerged in water.\nIn April 2023, floods submerged Bunta Village. The water almost touched the floor of the Wahono stilt house.\nIn 2019, shortly after PT GNI built a nickel smelter area, flooding also occurred. That year was the first time people's houses were flooded for three months. Land transportation was cut off. PT GNI workers, who go to work via the Bunta Village road, also have to use boats.\nIt is true that there is usually a flood every five years in Bunta Village. However, since PT GNI came to close the river, the impact of the flooding has become worse, residents said.\nThe flood never stopped completely. Even in summer, residential land remains flooded with water.\n\"We can't stand it. \"To and fro the water,\" said Wahono.\nWahono has rice fields and oil palm plantations. Rice fields covering an area of ​​1 ha, oil palm plantations covering an area of ​​4 ha. Both are now no longer productive because the water never recedes.\nThe oil palm plantation is included in the PT GNI area. Apart from Wahono, there are around 37 ha of transmigrant land that is included in the industrial area. On average, residents have 2 ha of land. There are some who have 1 ha, there are also 6 ha.\nTheir land is now part of a \"national vital object\". Access for residents is difficult. The gates of PT GNI are closely guarded by security forces, from company security officers, police, to soldiers.\nResidents asked for compensation, including Wahono. However, PT GNI appreciates it with a land acquisition value of IDR 15 thousand/m² or IDR 150 million/ha. In fact, in 2019, the release price was IDR 2,500/m² or IDR 25 million/ha.\nWahono objected to the price.\nHe set the price of his land at IDR 50 thousand/m² or IDR 500 million/ha, taking into account that PT GNI sunk his oil palm plantations. But, the company refused.\n“But, their tricks are good. They drowned [the palm trees]. \"Finally, it became unproductive land,\" complained Wahono.\nWahono offered a middle way: asking PT GNI to help residents whose rice fields and gardens were sinking by converting them into ponds.\nPT GNI can lend tools and fuel to raise the embankments, providing a path for fish to descend to the empang. That way, said Wahono, society also has economic movement.\nHowever, the company ignored this proposal.\nWahono couldn't stay silent. Land as a source of livelihood for his family is a matter of life and death. And, as transmigrants, their land is limited.\nWahono tried to find another way. To get the company's attention, he closed the road in front of his house, the road used by PT GNI for motorized vehicles going in and out of the company.\nHowever, instead of listening to residents' complaints, PT GNI sent security forces to their homes. Police and soldiers came and opened the way. Wahono couldn't move.\nFinally, Wahono took the initiative to make a new excavation so that the river could flow. After complaining to the regent's office, DPRD and local police, the government lobbied PT GNI to allow Wahono to borrow tools to dig.\nWahono worked on it for two months.\nAnd, it's proven. Since the excavation, the ground surface has become dry again.\nHowever, after only two weeks, the river route was closed again by PT GNI.\n\"Because what I passed was a hauling road,\" said Wahono. \"I want to build a bridge. If they run out of water, please close. If they are excessive, open them. So that we can live together. But, no. They just closed.”\nWahono complained to the Governor of Central Sulawesi, Rusdy Mastura. Rusdy ordered his staff to go to the field.\nThe company's response was to raise the land surface of residential areas. The digging of a new river route was never granted. The house didn't sink anymore, but the puddle never disappeared.\nWahono's oil palm plantations and rice fields remain depleted.\"\n\n(Media Alkhairaat, 8/9/2022, media.alkhairaat.id): WALHI Central Sulawesi Reveals Results of Investigation of Impact of Morut Nickel Company Activities\n\"The Forum for the Environment (WALHI) of Central Sulawesi Province (Sulteng) conducted an investigation regarding the presence and activities of the nickel mining company PT. Stardust Estate Investment (SEI) and PT. Gun Buster Nickel Industry (GNI) in North Morowali Regency (Morut).\nChairman of the WALHI Regional Council for Central Sulawesi, Richard Labiro, said that we found facts and this has become a problematic issue in the community, especially Bunta Village, East Petasia District and Tanauge Village, Petasia District, North Morowali Regency (Morut)...\nHe said that the impact they found was that from an environmental perspective, the existence of a steam power plant (PLTU), residents of Hamlet 5, Bunta Village were exposed to Sulfur Dioxide (SO2) resulting from burning coal.\n\"And in the early morning, residents there feel fog, but it's not the usual fog like before company activities,\" he said.\nAlthough he said, there has been no impact felt by local communities such as ISPA and others, but vulnerable groups who are threatened include mothers, the elderly and children.\nApart from that, he said, due to the company filling up the Lampi River, when it rains even a little, the Lampi River water overflows into the settlements, plantations, rice fields and livestock of the residents of V Transmigration Hamlet, Bunta Village.\n“Even though the company is responsible for this. But it doesn't solve the problem. \"The company excavated land in the area to fill in flooded roads,\" he explained.\nHe said, regarding the incident of water overflowing into residential areas and others, local residents had reported it to the Governor of Central Sulawesi, but until now there had been no solution.\nMeanwhile, the impact felt by Tanauge residents, he explained, was that compensation was not transparent and the payment was not open, there was no socialization of compensation prices to the community from the previous local government.\nApart from that, according to him, the agreement on the area for the construction of the Jetty between the company and the residents changed at the beginning when it was agreed that the area was 15 hectares, but as time went by it was suspected that the area would be more than 15 hectares.\n\"So the water area has been privatized by the company to build a ring road,\" he said.\nEven for the activities of barges and towing barges for parking in front of residential areas, there is a price set by the company to be paid to the community, but the payment is not enjoyed by the residents, due to problems with the local village government.\n\"On the other hand, the local community is worried that their availability of clean water will be affected due to the expansion of the company area,\" he said.\nBased on the results of the investigation carried out, he said, Walhi, as an organizer on labor issues, will strengthen residents affected by the company's activities. And will take legal action if there are indications of environmental violations.\"", "Sources": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNMwbcycUY8&ab_channel=DPMPTSPKabupatenMorowaliUtara\n(Broken) https://dpmptsp.sultengprov.go.id/kunjungan-gubernur-sulawesi-tengah-ke-kawasan-industri-pt-stardust-estate-investment-di-kabupaten-morowali-utara/\n(Archived link, 7/4/22) https://web.archive.org/web/20220704212302/https://ytm.or.id/ytm-desak-pt-stardust-dan-gunbuster-segera-memenuhi-tuntutan-masyarakat-tanauge/\n(Broken) https://www.nickelmagazine.com/2022/04/smelter-industrial-area.html?m=1\nhttps://sulteng.antaranews.com/berita/263325/pt-sei-di-morut-sulteng-segera-miliki-investor-baru-untuk-pengolahan-nikel\nhttps://projectmultatuli.org/kami-dibiarkan-berkelahi-petani-morowali-utara-terimpit-perkebunan-sawit-dan-industri-nikel/\nhttps://media.alkhairaat.id/walhi-sulteng-beberkan-hasil-investigasi-dampak-aktivitas-perusahaan-nikel-morut/\n(Broken) http://m.ccidii.com/industrytrends/20230329/4525.html\nhttps://www.gem.wiki/Delong_Nickel_Phase_III_power_station\n(Broken) https://benua.id/operasi-pltu-captive-di-sulawesi-merusak/\nhttps://www.inews.id/finance/bisnis/dukung-hilirisasi-nikel-hillcon-bangun-pelabuhan-di-kawasan-industri-sei\nhttps://www.puda-en.com/news/indonesia-delong-phase-iii-gni-nickel-iron-pro-53701290.html\n(Archived link, 11/27/23) https://web.archive.org/web/20231127172956/https://kemenperin.go.id/kawasan\nhttps://jatam.org/id/lengkap.php?slug=arogansi-pt-gni-dan-jejaring-kepentingan-elit-politik-di-balik-peristiwa-bentrokan-tki-dan-tka-di-morowali-utara" }, "geometry": { "type": "Point", "coordinates": [ 121.4067949, -2.01153078 ] } },

At least the level of environmental pollution from industrial waste can be minimized.\n\"The question then is, why is the problem of environmental pollution in this area still occurring and is still occurring to this day. \"This means that there is something wrong with the waste management there, and to what extent the supporting budget for this has been used, whether it has been maximized and according to its intended purpose, or are you sure it is on target,\" explained Kadir.\nHe also questioned the implementation of the vision and mission by PT KIMA, which has a mission for a quality green industrial area and a vision to become a smart, modern and green area management company with the largest output.\n\"This is what PT KIMA must prioritize as the sole manager of the industrial area there. So basically all industrial companies in the area have tenant status. \"They rent tenants or space provided by PT KIMA and of course with supporting facilities including waste management facilities,\" said Kadir.\nHe asked APH to investigate more deeply the SOP for waste management managed by PT KIMA, starting from the inspection process, supervision, capacity or condition of waste storage areas, which of course should change along with the increasing activity of companies renting tenants or premises in the area.\n\"I think the focus should be here because it is related to the use of a very large budget which is related to the problem of environmental pollution due to the alleged impact of waste management which is still poor or not in accordance with existing regulations. \"We are waiting for APH's seriousness in investigating this case,\" Kadir stressed.\nPreviously, in a Hearing Meeting (RDP) discussing the issue of environmental pollution of the Tallo River tributary, Parangloe River, Parangloe Village, Tamalanrea District, Makassar which was initiated by Commission C of the Makassar City DPRD, a number of important points were revealed.\nOne of them, it was revealed that a number of companies in KIMA had fulfilled their obligation to pay money every month to PT. KIMA as the sole operator in the industrial area is related to waste management.\nThe obligations paid by a number of companies to KIMA are said to vary in value. Some make monthly deposits of IDR 4 million to IDR 5 million, depending on the volume of waste generated from the company's activities in question.\n\"Don't DLH or anyone else blame the companies at KIMA, don't say that PT at that time was like this and like this, the one responsible for the waste conditions at KIMA, not the businessman, he paid,\" said Chairman of Commission C of the Makassar City DPRD, Sangkala Saddiko while leading RDP discussed the issue of pollution of the Tallo River tributary, Parangloe River, Tamalanrea District, Makassar in the Makassar DPRD Banggar Room, Wednesday 17 May 2023.\n“How much does PT Wahyu pay? 4-5 million?. Well, he pays, so if waste like that occurs it is not the entrepreneur's responsibility, the responsibility is PT KIMA because this has been a long-standing problem. \"So where has KIMA been responsible for the past few years?\" Sangkala Saddiko said.\nHe admitted that he was surprised that the Makassar City Environmental Service (DLH), which was also present at the RDP, said that it had carried out inspections and so on. However, the problem of environmental pollution around KIMA is thought to be due to industrial waste still occurring.\n\"If the inspection was carried out intensively then nothing like this would happen. \"I admit that the environment is our partner. I always ask if he proposes regulations like that, but the question is why it still happens like that,\" said Sangkala Saddiko.\n\"Remember, all the entrepreneurs there are making payments, don't accuse this PT, this PT is responsible for the waste, what is clear is that I asked Indofood, I asked Sari Roti and so on, it all comes down to KIMA, because he said PT KIMA oversees waste matters, so \"That's not the responsibility of the entrepreneur, the responsibility is the manager, in this case PT KIMA,\" explained Sangkala Saddiko.\nHe said that he was elected from the Biringkanaya electoral district, Tamalanrea and knows exactly the problems experienced by the community regarding waste.\n\"I once said to the residents, can you still stand a smell like this? \"If it was in accordance with the existing progress, it wouldn't have happened like that. If, for example, it went like that, the entrepreneur at KIMA wanted to carry out his activities well, so he paid to comply with the existing regulations. I was sent proof of their payment,\" Sangkala Saddiko said again.\nHe also admitted that he was a regular road user in Kapasa Raya. That night he passed by and opened his car window. The stench approached.\n\"That's why I asked from the Environmental Service earlier, if the waste mechanism was running, it wouldn't have happened like that and this, sir, I was a member of the DPRD for two terms and passed by there every day, last night, sir, when I opened the glass door, I came in with a bad smell. \"It's not good, what DLH said earlier, according to the mechanism, it's like that,\" explained Sangkala Saddiko.\nThe PT KIMA representative who was present at the RDP explained that PT. KIMA has a number of companies under it and is bound by an agreement.\nWhen starting an agreement with the tenant, there is an attachment to the waste water quality standards required by the tenant.\n\"We have that,\" answered the PT KIMA representative in the RDP.\n\"Then related to how it is managed, from us it is 24 hour operational when it comes to temperature, PH, CO and DO every week, so we analyze all the required parameters according to the company every week a month,\" explained the PT KIMA representative.\nHe also explained that since 2022, PT KIMA has been required by the Ministry of the Environment to provide tools called sparing and sparing tools. And this tool has been installed at PT KIMA's waste water outlet to monitor the environment directly.\n\"That is an obligation that we have carried out,\" said the PT KIMA representative.\nRegarding environmental performance, he admitted that he had held PROPER since 2004. Where PT KIMA achieved blue PROPER. These are the environmental performances that the party will probably carry out at this time.\n\"Then regarding why the waste water that reaches the Tallo River tributary is black, actually if you look at our environmental documents, our documents were actually written from the start. \"Our responsibility extends to the water bodies before the Tallo River tributaries,\" explained the PT KIMA representative.\n\"However, looking at the current fact that along the canal created by KIMA, the community and all entrepreneurs outside KIMA have connected it, so in 2018 at the Ministry of the Environment we revised the document, the ministry issued that it could no longer be charged by PT KIMA related responsibility along the canal,\" continued the PT KIMA representative.\n\"Why, because along the canal there are many connections from terminals, from markets and all MSME businesses, entrepreneurs and all kinds of things are all there. \"So the responsibility for environmental control is transferred to us, so we can only reach the beach point at the Sector Police,\" added the PT KIMA representative.\nHe admitted that the problem now is because everything is connected. In the past, he continued, when the wall was still intact and then it was broken into by the Head of the Daya Village, he also asked a Makasaar City Government official who at that time was known as Manai Sofyan.\n\"I asked why the wall was broken into, it would be polluted by the community, he said where else would the community's water go if it didn't come this way. \"So that's the reason, I still remember that time I went down to the field and we saw that our channels were already connected,\" emphasized the PT KIMA representative.\nTallo River Tributary Pollution Complaint\nThe Makassar City Environmental Service (DLH) discovered several facts about alleged environmental pollution that occurred in the Parangloe River, a tributary of the Tallo River, Parangloe Village, Tamalanrea District.\nFirst, there was foam in the Parangloe River, then there were dead fish and shrimp in residents' ponds which were approximately 50 meters from the river location in question.\nThe facts found in the field were based on documentary evidence in the form of videos and photos reported by a resident of Bontoa village, Parangloe Village, Tamalanrea District regarding the presence of foam on the surface of water bodies that spread across the Parangloe River.\n\"Now after discovering this fact, the team carried out a cross-check in the field with the aim of identifying and collecting data as material for further analysis,\" said Acting Head of DLH Makassar City, Ferdi, Monday 15 May 2023.\nThen Ferdi revealed that reports of water pollution in the Parangloe River, which he admitted was thought to be the result of industrial activities, had been discovered the previous year by the monitoring team.\n\"So this data and verification will be a complement or support for follow-up material,\" he explained.\nThen there are several companies that operate from downstream points to the West Ring Road along the Parangloe River, namely PT. KTC, PT MT, PT BFM, PT FKS MA.tbk, PT CPI (RPHU).\n\"There are still several other companies that have not been identified,\" he explained.\nHowever, based on the results of interviews with people around the location, information was obtained that there were five residential drainage channels that flowed down to the Parangloe River.\n\"This has not been identified because the weather at that time was rainy,\" he said.\nMeanwhile, the location of the drainage channel for the residents of Bontoa Village is the Komunai Waste Water Disposal Installation (IPAL) which was built by the Makassar City Public Works Department in 2019.\n\"According to the local RW, the IPAL is no longer used because there is a blockage in the channel so that residents' septic tank waste water automatically flows into the drainage and then into the river,\" he said.\nNot only that, some of the houses of Bontoa Village residents cross the banks of the Parangloe River, so it is estimated that domestic wastewater is directly discharged into the river.\n\"There is a narrowing of the width of the Parangloe river at coordinates 5° 5'47.93″S\n119°28'21.60\"E so that the river water does not flow smoothly and there is a buildup of sediment which causes a smell and black water,\" he explained.\nHowever, based on the results of field parameter tests, it was revealed that the Parangloe River is a tributary of the Tallo River which is located in two sub-districts, namely Tamalanrea and Biringkanaya.\nThe activities along the Parangloe River are residential, industrial and pond activities. So these activities affect the carrying capacity and water quality of the Parangloe River.\nIt could even be fatal if the population increases and industrial activities along the Parangloe River affect the environmental conditions of the Parangloe River.\n\"Domestic wastewater discharge originating from residential areas and industry that is not managed properly will cause sedimentation and river water quality. \"This can be seen physically in the condition of the Parangloe River water,\" he explained.\nApart from residents' domestic wastewater, industrial and pond activities also contribute to the water quality of the Parangloe River. Moreover, industries that do not treat their wastewater properly will cause public unrest.\nFerdi explained that the appearance of floating or foamy foam could also be concluded from natural factors, namely the natural cycle of rain falling from the sky or the discharge of waste water all at once.\n\"To find out this, integrated monitoring is carried out involving environmental monitoring functions,\" he added. (Tamrin/Eka)\n\nEnvironmental Impact:\nSuspected improper waste management, polluting local rivers\n\n(Kedai Berita, 5/20/23,kedai-berita.com) : APH Asked to Investigate Corruption in Use of Waste Management Budget at KIMA\nA number of anti-corruption activist institutions in South Sulawesi are busy asking Law Enforcement Officials (APH) to investigate the smell of corruption in waste management budget activities in the Makassar Industrial Area (KIMA).\n\"The problem of waste pollution in the riverbank areas there never stops and there is no solution. \"Finally, the pond farming community on the banks of the Tallo River tributary, the Parangloe River, was once again affected, their fish died, allegedly because they were exposed to industrial waste from KIMA,\" said Chairman of the Sulawesi Anti-Corruption Committee Working Body (ACC Sulawesi) Kadir Wokanubun.\n\"So I think it is very important that this case be investigated and brought into the realm of corruption, how exactly is waste management at KIMA, there will be a budget and it is very large, but how come there are still waste problems there which people around KIMA continue to complain about,\" Kadir added. \nHe believes that if the use of the waste management budget at KIMA goes according to its intended purpose and is right on target, then there will be no pollution to the surrounding environment caused by industrial waste. At least the level of environmental pollution from industrial waste can be minimized.\n\"The question then is, why is the problem of environmental pollution in this area still occurring and is still occurring to this day. \"This means that there is something wrong with the waste management there, and to what extent the supporting budget for this has been used, whether it has been maximized and according to its intended purpose, or are you sure it is on target,\" explained Kadir.", "Sources": "https://madeinindonesia.com/images/minisite/itpc_uae/MAKASSAR-MAROS%20INDUSTRIAL%20ESTATE.pdf\nhttps://www.adrianoplegroup.com/post/zone-profile-makassar-industrial-estate\nhttps://kedai-berita.com/2023/05/20/aph-diminta-usut-aroma-korupsi-pemanfaatan-anggaran-pengelolaan-limbah-di-kima/\n(Archived link, 11/27/23) https://web.archive.org/web/20231127172956/https://kemenperin.go.id/kawasan\nhttp://ptkimamakassar.co.id/\nhttps://sulawesi.bisnis.com/read/20231026/539/1708089/kawasan-industri-makassar-didorong-gaet-investor\nhttps://ptkimamakassar.co.id/profile/" }, "geometry": { "type": "Point", "coordinates": [ 119.497902, -5.104643 ] } },

For centuries, the O Hongana Manyawa tribe, one of these last indigenous groups, have roamed the forests of Indonesia's remote Halmahera island in small family bands tied closely to rivers in the island’s interior.\nBut today Kumbang’s family and their indigenous culture face an existential threat—one fueled by an industry widely touted for its green credentials, and often heralded as a panacea to the growing climate crisis. \nWhere there was once vast rainforest, today an expanding massive nickel mining venture is clearing the homeland of O Hongana Manyawa, as suppliers in Indonesia race to fulfill a growing global demand for batteries powering the electric vehicle industry.\nKumbang no longer lives with his family in the rainforest, but he fears for their future as he watches the rainforest shrink around them. Their staple foods of carb-rich sago palm fruits have been razed and rivers providing drinking water poisoned by mining run-off; the rattan fibers used for clothing have become harder to find, while resin-producing trees, the sap from which is used for torches, have been obliterated. Mining encampments filled with thousands of men and security forces now occupy the hunting grounds where O Hongana Manyawa once chased deer and wild pigs for food.\n“The forest is everything, it is their heart and life,” said Kumbang. The young man’s name has been changed to protect his identity due to what NGOs and activists say are credible threats to his safety for speaking out about the issue. “My parents and siblings are in the forest and without support they will die.”\nEnvironmental groups and indigenous rights activists have sounded the alarm in recent days. They allege that mining company Weda Bay Nickel and other similar projects are destroying the traditional lands of the O Hongana Manyawa, also known as the Forest Tobelo, and are at risk of devastating their forest-dependent way of life. \nThe mining projects form part of Indonesia’s emerging electric vehicle battery supply chain, into which major electric vehicle firm Tesla has reportedly invested $5 billion so far, while partnering with several companies connected to Weda Bay in the past year. \nIn the last few months, two leading French and German firms have also announced they’re on the verge of pouring billions more into electric vehicle battery production sourced from Weda Bay Nickel, touting its compliance with the “highest international environmental, social and governance standards.” This includes the Initiative for Responsible Mining Assurance standards, which requires Free, Prior and Informed Consent (FPIC) from indigenous peoples affected by the project.\nBut rather than securing the consent of O Hongana Manyawa, Weda Bay Nickel has ravaged their lands and livelihoods, Kumbang and indigenous activist groups say.\n“I will never give consent for the company to use our lands,” Kumbang said.\nHongana Manyawa number around 3,000 people across Halmahera, the largest island in eastern Indonesia’s Northern Maluku province. Many of them, like Kumbang, who is now a Christian, were born in the forest and later adopted via missionary-led interventions or resettled through government policies to integrate O Hongana Manyawa into Indonesian society in recent decades. Many still retain ties to the forest and Kumbang says he visits his parents regularly.\nBetween 300 and 500 members of O Hongana Manyawa, like Kumbang’s family and relatives, are still considered “uncontacted\" because they remain in voluntary isolation in the forests of Halmahera, says Sophie Grig, senior researcher for the indigenous rights nonprofit Survival International. The unsettled members of the tribe hunt and tend to bamboo gardens throughout the forest, limiting their interactions with outsiders.\n“They rely on the forest for everything that enables them to live and survive and thrive,” Grig told VICE World News. Without the forest, “they won’t be able to sustain themselves.”\nYet the outside world is forcing itself upon O Hongana Manyawa.\nWeda Bay Nickel’s approximately 45,000 hectare concession was awarded in 1998 by Indonesia’s then military dictator Suharto. After Weda Bay Nickel’s operations stalled for several years due to a nickel market downturn, the project resumed with renewed intensity after Chinese conglomerate Tsingshan Holding Group came on board with a controlling stake through a subsidiary in 2017. As the mining has reached further into the forests of Halmahera, riverways have been filled in with ore to form roads penetrating into the tribe’s territory, cutting off O Hongana Manyawa from drinking water, says Kumbang, who still regularly travels into the forest to visit his family. \nEven when the government later expanded forest protections in 1999, Weda Bay’s concession was carved out by presidential decree in 2004 to allow for tens of thousands of hectares of deforestation from open pit mining. Weda Bay Nickel has since contributed to the more than 47,000 hectares of the estimated 724,000 hectares of natural forest in Central and Eastern Halmahera cleared between 2017 and 2021, according to data from Forest Watch Indonesia and local environmental journalist Christ Belseran. Much more is expected in the coming years as the nickel mining projects expand to meet global demand.\nAnnas Rasyid, an activist with the Indonesian Indigenous People’s Alliance (AMAN), says that O Hongana Manyawa’s sustainable way of life is under threat from decades-long government policies to “civilize” them, forcing families to live in sweltering and cramped tin roofed permanent homes. Some nomadic O Hongana Manyawa have become dependent on company handouts like instant noodles and rice, while members of the tribe have also become scapegoats for authorities—tortured and imprisoned for crimes they likely did not commit and cleared off their land as a result, he added. \nWhen the government grants a mining concession there is never consultation with local people, because authorities do not consider them as owners of the land under Indonesian law, Rasyid says. \n\"In their perspective, the land belongs to the government,” he explained, adding that Indonesian lawmakers, many with financial links to companies using indigenous lands, have refused to pass legislation that would provide stronger legal rights for indigenous peoples.\nIndonesia is the world’s leading nickel producer, and has welcomed foreign investment by courting manufacturers like Tesla to grow its electric vehicle battery production. However, the industry’s development ignores any meaningful recognition of indigenous peoples, says Novenia Ambeua. She’s Chair of the activist group North Maluku Region Indigenous Peoples Alliance of the Archipelago, and a member of the Tobelo, a coastal indigenous group with close connections to O Hongana Manyawa, whose community’s territory has also been impacted by Weda Bay Nickel.\n“These are the forests which we guard for the future generation and now they are being destroyed for electric cars, where is the heart of people in the west?” Ambeua told VICE World News. “This is making everything worse.”\nIndonesia is the world’s leading nickel producer, and has welcomed foreign investment by courting manufacturers like Tesla to grow its electric vehicle battery production. However, the industry’s development ignores any meaningful recognition of indigenous peoples, says Novenia Ambeua. She’s Chair of the activist group North Maluku Region Indigenous Peoples Alliance of the Archipelago, and a member of the Tobelo, a coastal indigenous group with close connections to O Hongana Manyawa, whose community’s territory has also been impacted by Weda Bay Nickel.\n“These are the forests which we guard for the future generation and now they are being destroyed for electric cars, where is the heart of people in the west?” Ambeua told VICE World News. “This is making everything worse.”\nWeda Bay’s mining kicked off in 2019 and plans to extract 40,000 tons of nickel every year for the next four decades. \nTesla, the world’s second biggest electric car manufacturer, signed deals in July 2022 to source processed nickel from two Chinese suppliers, which in turn get nickel from the Chinese conglomerate Tsingshan Holding Group and are both shareholders of the Weda Bay industrial park. \nTesla CEO Elon Musk has boasted of selling 20 million electric vehicles in 2030, but his company’s promise to shareholders of ethically sourced nickel is “just an empty message,” said  Indonesia’s Mining Advocacy Network (JATAM) in a 2022 report. Despite clear evidence that suppliers like Tsingshan were carrying out destructive actions against indigenous peoples and local communities, this didn’t stop Tesla from signing deals with them, the report highlights.\n\"Tesla must know that the electric vehicle battery supply chain has negative social impacts on Indonesian citizens,” JATAM director Melky Nahar told VICE World News. “So if Tesla buys nickel from companies in Central Halmahera, indirectly Tesla is involved in these impacts.”\nFurther foreign investment into the area’s electric vehicle battery industry has just been finalized and more is expected in the coming months. Australian firm Thiess announced last month an $87 million ore-hauling contract for Weda Bay Nickel, declaring it looked forward to “building strong relationships with the local community.” In January, Bloomberg reported that German chemical giant BASF is also finalizing a multi-billion dollar deal with Weda Bay Nickel’s Eramet to develop a smelter for nickel coming from the tribe's forest lands. BASF told VICE World News that it “has not yet decided whether such a project will be implemented.” Activists say this project would also directly threaten the lives of O Hongana Manyawa and their neighbors. \nSurvival International and other indigenous rights groups say that despite claims that these projects are in compliance with international standards, nickel produced by Weda Bay is in violation of widely recognized UN and World Bank requirements for FPIC agreements from indigenous peoples.\nWeda Bay previously received $207 million in World Bank guarantees for its investment, legally requiring FPIC, though a World Bank audit following a complaint dismissed these concerns in 2011 and urged the company to continue dialogue with affected communities. Many of the surrounding coastal indigenous communities ultimately signed agreements under pressure and threat from police and local authorities, accepting extremely low prices for their lands. But O Hongana Manyawa living in the forests never agreed to cede their lands to the company, Kumbang says. \nWeda Bay Nickel knows that its mining concession overlaps with the territory of nomadic, isolated groups from O Hongana Manyawa who reject mining on their lands, according to an internal company report obtained by VICE World News. \nThe 2013 report, funded by Weda Bay Nickel and prepared by the U.S.-based firm Cross-Cultural Consulting Services, found evidence of multiple groups of O Hongana Manyawa living inside the mining concession. The consulting firm verified the report’s existence but told VICE World News it no longer works with Weda Bay Nickel. \nO Hongana Manyawa “do not like to interact with outsiders” and it would be “unethical” to seek to contact them, the report notes. “The critical issue… is how to apply FPIC when a good proportion of the indigenous population does not want to be contacted.”\nGiven that the company has been mining since 2019, any claims of securing “prior” consent are a charade, Grig points out.\n“They cannot possibly have had free, prior and informed consent because these people are uncontacted,” Grig said. “How could you possibly get FPIC from an uncontacted tribe?”\nTesla’s indigenous rights policy requires free and informed consent from its suppliers.\nTesla, Weda Bay, and all other companies named did not respond to repeated requests for comment from VICE World News. Survival International has called on Tesla to publicly commit to not sourcing nickel from any suppliers mining on O Hongana Manyawa’s lands. \nWeda Bay says it will respect indigenous ways of life, but the mine’s destruction has already violated the site of Kumbang’s own birth, he says, where his umbilical cord is buried beneath an ngofa ngoe sapling. In O Hongana Manyawa language, the name means “tree with many children,” and its growth was supposed to symbolize Kumbang’s own future family. \nBut the last time Kumbang returned to the area in September, his birth grove had been bulldozed to muddy, red earth for Weda Bay’s mining operations.\n“It broke my heart,” Kumbang said. “Everything in the forest is getting destroyed now—the river, the animals, it is all gone.”\"\n\n(Mongabay, 3/8/23, mongabay.co.id): Stories of Tobelo Indigenous Women Fighting When Damaged Forest Turns into a Mine\n\"\"-The Tobelo Dalam indigenous women and those living in coastal villages protested the destruction of the customary forest to make way for a nickel mine and various supporting facilities. Like last October, indigenous people, including women, blocked heavy equipment operations.\n-Novenia Ambeua,  an indigenous woman of Tobelo descent on the South Wasile coast , said that for the Tobelo people, the forest is home and sacred . If the forest is damaged, everything in it will also be damaged. Forests provide everything, from food such as hunting, medicine to sources of livelihood, including looking for resin.  Indigenous people's gardens are also in the forest.\n-The community rejects PT IWIP's expansion into Akejira Mein's  ( Aruku Ma Ngairi ) Indigenous Forest . They also demanded that the company stop paying compensation or compassion to other parties suspected of acting on behalf of the land owner.  \n-Achmad Zakih , Secretary of the North Maluku Forestry Service, dismissed the threat of forests in Central Halmahera. However, he said that it is necessary to strengthen the existence of indigenous peoples who have lived and lived in the forest for generations through a stipulation through regional regulations.\"\"\nWhile recognizing that it was unethical, the report nevertheless made preparations for how to gradually approach and gain consent of groups which remained in voluntary isolation. \n“It came down to the fact that this [mining project] was going to happen,” Chris Duncan, the lead researcher hired by Weda Bay to produce its 2013 report and an anthropologist who has been studying O Hongana Manyawa since the 1990s, told VICE World News. Duncan said the logic was: “Let's try to make it better, as opposed to just opposing it. In the end we failed—we didn't get FPIC, which was the goal.” \n“These people [O Hongana Manyawa] have been screwed for decades and they will continue to get screwed,” he said.\nThe company has “good relations” with O Hongana Manyawa and identified 22 of the tribe’s cultural heritage sites inside its concession while implementing FPIC principles, an IWIP representative said in a 2019 statement, citing the same 2013 plan which had “failed” according to its lead researcher. \nThe day after VICE World News emailed Eramet CEO Christel Bories, the company posted two statements on its website. Eramet said it had launched a “currently ongoing” study in 2023 with a local anthropologist to research the impact of the mine and “ensure we understand and respect the way of life” of O Hongana Manyawa.\n“In the event that indigenous peoples may be affected by our activities, further dialogue is required, leading to the consent of these communities to the company's operations,” Eramet said in another statement posted on April 7, adding the company committed to being “audited” to show compliance with international standards.\nThe company also said there are no O Hongana Manyawa in coastal areas and that its planned project with BASF would not directly impact them. But O Hongana Manyawa do not live on the coast, they live in the interior forest, and the smelter would source nickel from that area, indigenous activist groups say.\nEramet did not respond directly to VICE World News’ requests for comment.\nKumbang said he has been approached multiple times in the past few years by Weda Bay Nickel and its hired anthropologist to retroactively gain consent for mining operations on his relatives’ land. Kumbang repeatedly refused. The anthropologist did not respond to requests for comment from VICE World News. \n\n(Environmental Justice Atlas, 1/31/2023, ejatlas.org): \"\"The IWIP and the associated nickel mining and processing activities have significant impacts on the environment, biodiversity, and the indigenous communities in the area [8]–[10]. Back in 2010, Indonesian community and advocacy groups JATAM (Mining Advocacy Network), WALHI, KIARA, and KAU formed an international coalition to oppose the project and the World Bank’s support of WBN [11]. The groups filed a complaint with the Compliance Advisor Ombudsman (CAO) of the World Bank [11]. Earlier studies indicated that there were significant barriers to access meaningful redress for communities that are remote in the area [2].\nOver the years, the Indonesian government has been trying to resettle the indigenous group in the region outside the forest and force them to adopt conventional settled lifestyles instead of their traditional nomadic lifestyle. These people, called the O Hongana Manyawa (also referred to as Tobelo Dalam, which allegedly was against the wishes of the people themselves [11]) and means “forest people” in their indigenous language. They are one of the five last remaining nomadic Indigenous Peoples in Indonesia and categorized as endangered [3], [12] according to Aliansi Masyarakat Adat Nusantara (Indigenous Peoples Alliance of the Archipelago, AMAN), the main representative organization for Indonesia’s indigenous peoples. According to an interview with Tupa, one of the members of the six remaining tribes that are still practicing the traditional nomadic lifestyle in the forest, “Trees are gone and replaced with the big road, where giant machines go in and out making noise and driving the animals away” [3]. For the few last remaining tribe members in the forest, the forest is not only a place to inhabitat and find sources of food, it is “also a home and ‘the bridge’ that connects them with the spiritual world” [3]. It was also reported that a local resident of Lelilef Sawai Village indicated that she and other mothers were prohibited from fishing in Tanjung Uli, Karkar, and Cacu and from taking firewood [9]. The reclamation of nickel ore storage areas by PT IWIP in the Karkar area also affected local fishing activities that used to take place in the same area [9].\nAccording to the fieldwork and report of Indonesian NGO AEER, the villagers of Lelilef Sawai, Lelilef Waibulan, and Gemaf complained about respiratory problems due to air pollution from the captive coal-fired power plants that use low calorie coal with a calorie content of only 4,200 kcal/kg [9]. Local residents also had restricted access to clean water, with the 3km Ake Sake River dammed and diverted for the construction of one of the IWIP smelters and other rivers such as Seslewe Sini and Kobe polluted [9]. AEER indicated that the increase of logging and the damming and diversion of the Ake Sake River has led to deforestation and reduced water absorption capacity and contributed to the flood that took place in August 2020 which inundated the villages and roads, including the IWIP area [9].\nDuring the inaugural ceremony of the IWIP project in 2018, IWIP claimed that they had obtained community consent and that Akejira nomads, which Tupa belongs to, had agreed to the nickel mining activity in Central Halmahera [3]. This was questioned by Munadi Kilkoda, the regional chief of AMAN Malut (North Maluku) [13]. Some local residents had no other choice but to sell land to the company and the bid price from the companies was  low (e.g. IDR 8,000-9,000 per sq metre, equal to around half a euro) based on regional regulations [9]. While the majority of residents have sold their land, a few have refused to do so. It was reported that “intimidation by security forces, and dispossession of access to forest and other social and environmental concerns have sparked protest and denunciations of the projects” [11]. Some protests took place in 2019 by the relatives of O Hongana Manyawa band that live in Akejira forest [3]. Another protest took place in July 2020, when 450 South Wasile residents walked for two days to Kao Rahai, where PT WBN was opening a new nickel mining area, and blockaded roads by building tents and halting mining activities [9].\nIn addition, there were protests from students and civil society organizations in Ternate. AMAN urged IWIP to 1) comply with international laws and treaties including ILO Convention 169 and the UN Declaration on the rights of the indigenous peoples; 2) implement free, prior, informed consent (FPIC) on all forms of policies before operations that affect the livelihood of indigenous peoples; and 3) comply with Indonesian law, especially the Constitutional Court Decision Number 35/PUU-X/2012 regarding customary forests (not state forests) [3]. Students protested in Ternate and in Tobelo, North Halmahera, including the Student Action Solidarity for the Indonesian People (Samurai) Malut and the Sylfa Student Association of Kharun University [5], [14], [15]. The latter held a protest with the theme “Save Ake Jira, the Heart of Halmahera and the Tobelo Dalam Tribe”. The students demanded that the Halteng Regency Government ratify a local regulation on indigenous peoples in order to protect this tribe [5],[3]. IWIP representative responded [16] that they had obtained a borrow-to-use forest area permit (IPPKH) and that the Tobelo Dalam community is one of the main stakeholders in their mining concession, with whom they had developed a good relationship [5]. On the other hand, the issue of Ake Jira’s customary forest reached the Presidential Secretariat Office (KSP) in Jakarta with a letter sent by AMAN Malut that complained about the issues faced by the indigenous people of Tobelo Dalam in Central Halmahera after the arrival of WBN and IWIP in the area [16]. KSP issued a letter that urged the companies to respect and protect the indigenous people of Tobelo Dalam and align with the recommendations put forward by AMAN [16].\nOn 23 October 2019, another demonstration was held by Aliansi Masyarakat Ake Jira Halmahera (the Ake Jira Halmahera Community Alliance, AMARAH) in front of the Ternate Mayor’s office [17]. The crowd carried banners reading \"\" Selamatkan Ake Jira” (“Save Ake Jira”) and asked for the revocation of the Mining Business Permit (IUP) of IWIP, WBN and PT Tekindo Energy [17]. The AMARAH alliance is a coalition of NGOs, civic organizations, movements, and student associations, including Walhi Malut, AMAN Malut, LBH Marimoi, Daurmala, FNKSD, Sekolah Critis, GeMPAR, SAMURAI, LMND, GAMHAS, The Buas, PANDECTA, KAMMI IAIN, Jendela Mahasiswa Politik, Pusmat, Gemah IAIN, Jejak Timur, SEMUT, DEMA Ekonomi IAIN, and Gerilya Institut [17]. A representative of the demonstrators indicated that the mining activities in the Ake Jira forest not only threatens the Tobelo Dalam, but also has an impact on the waterbody in the region [17]. It was also indicated that the residents of Tobelo Dalam that lived in Ake Jira had left their original residential area due to massive mining activities, while AMARAH representative did not know where they had left for at the moment [14], [17].\"\"\"\n\n(Environmental Justice Atlas, 1/31/2023, ejatlas.org): \"According to the fieldwork and report of Indonesian NGO AEER, the villagers of Lelilef Sawai, Lelilef Waibulan, and Gemaf complained about respiratory problems due to air pollution from the captive coal-fired power plants that use low calorie coal with a calorie content of only 4,200 kcal/kg [9].

Moreover, the family life of the farming residents is very dependent on the land.\n\"Therefore, the paradigm that must be built in carrying out land acquisition for residents is not to compensate for land losses, but to compensate for profits,\" said Muhlis.\nThe local government, Muhlis emphasized again, must be really clear about this. Do not issue policies that actually harm society. Moreover, in the momentum of land acquisition for residents, many parties want to make a profit.\n\"We want to emphasize to all parties, not to seek profit from the suffering of the people,\" concluded Muhlis.\"\n\n(Harian Halmahera, 2/18/21, https://harianhalmahera.com/halut/negosiasi-penentu-operasi-pt-emerald/): \"... if there is no solution to the price negotiation or it is agreed upon, PT.EFI continued to be said by the Halut Head of Nakertrans, company management stated that they would continue to operate by changing the plan from before, namely that the building would be rebuilt on another land in the company's own location. \"Management of PT.

One of them is in the case of land in North Halmahera Regency, North Maluku.\nThe land case in North Halmahera involved the assistant supreme judge, Preastio Nugroho. Where, he allegedly received IDR 725 million from the Chairman of the Tobelo District Court (PN), I Gusti Ngurah Putu Rama Wijaya.\n\"(Prasetio Nugroho) received IDR 725 million.\" That's what the Corruption Eradication Commission (KPK) charges, as quoted by detikcom, kalesang.id, Friday (19/5/2023).\nThe handover of money worth IDR 725 million was received by Preastio Nugroho at Rest Area KM 19 of the Jakarta-Cikampek Toll Road, South Tambun District, Bekasi Regency on February 18 2022.\nThe money came from PT Emerald Ferochromium Industry (PT.EFI) as respondent I, in civil cassation case Number 542 K/Pdt/2022 regarding the dispute between applicant Marjon Ahiki and the mining company PT Emerald Ferochromium Industry which currently operates in Kao District , North Halmahra\nThe IDR 725 million, as the prosecutor said, was then received by 3 people, including Prasetio Nugroho, IDR 85 million, Supreme Court staff Redhy Novariasza IDR 60 million, and the remainder was received by Supreme Court PNA Muhajir Habibie.\nIn a copy of the cassation file quoted by detikcom, the dispute was initially heard at the Tobelo District Court, North Halmahera. Where, Marjon Ahiki fought PT. EFI, North Halmahera Regency Government and Pricing Team.\nMarjon Ahiki asked the Supreme Court to decide that the price determination by the Forkopimda Pricing Team of the North Halmahera Regency Government must be canceled by law.\nThen, stating the results of land measurements by PT company officers. EFI is legally flawed and must be canceled by law.\nMarjon asked for compensation for the price of land per meter in Gulo Village worth IDR 150 thousand/meter. Then, on November 24 2021, the Tobelo District Court did not accept Marjon Ahiki's application.\nThis is the reason why Marjon Ahiki filed an appeal to have his lawsuit granted. As a result, the Supreme Court also rejected Marjon Ahiki's appeal on February 21 2022.\nAfter investigating, 3 days before the decision there was a flow of funds from the Chairman of the Tobelo District Court. Even so, the Corruption Eradication Commission (KPK) in its indictment did not say whether the funds reached the cassation panel.

The company operates in residential areas\nArdi said KIBA is located in the coastal area of ​​Pa'jukukang District, Bantaeng. The land area of ​​this national strategic project reaches 3,151 hectares.\"To support the company's activities, an export port and a 101 hectare wind power plant will be built in the Pa'jukukang waters,\" said Ardi. PT Huadi is the first smelter factory to be inaugurated in Bantaeng in January 2019 at KIBA. According to the local community, the company is said to have exported 15 times, starting from November 2018.vThere are three companies operating at KIBA. Namely, PT Huadi, Yatai and Wozhou. The company's operations are right next to the settlements of coastal residents in Papanloe Village. The seven hamlets in the village are directly affected by the activities of companies that produce materials for nickel raw materials.vThe coastal area of ​​Pa'jukukang is said to be designated as KIBA because it is considered dry and the land is unproductive. Even though most of the people there work as fishermen, seaweed farmers, the red stone manufacturing industry, and there are also rice fields. \"Especially in Papanloe Village, there are still 160 seaweed farmers, 114 of whom depend on the seaweed business,\" Ardi explained his data.\n2. The company's activities destroy the source of income for residents\nArdi said the activity of material transport ships disrupted farmers' seaweed cultivation. Seaweed locations that meet directly with ports and ship lanes are often damaged by being hit by ships. As a result, the location of the stretch of seaweed is damaged and unable to continue cultivation. Not only disrupting seaweed cultivation, the activities of material transport vessels also disrupt fishermen's fishing grounds. Of the seven hamlets in Papanloe Village, Mawang Hamlet is the hamlet that feels the most impact from the company's activities. The common impact that occurs is pollution. \"Such as smell, dust and noise,\" said Ardi. Dust, sourced from several company activities. Such as dust from material transport vehicles that use village roads as well as public access roads used by residents. Another source of dust, comes from drying the ore to the burning process through the furnace. The combustion process is also a source of dust as well as emits a pungent odor. \"To describe the smell, residents call it the smell of scorched canvas. The noise for 24 hours comes from heavy equipment activity in the company area, material transport car activities, and sounds in the form of bangs,\" said Ardi. Not to mention the problem of drought. In September 2021, the residents' wells in the Balla Tinggia hamlet, Kayu Loe and Mawang hamlet, Papanloe Village dried up. The drought is thought to have been caused by the drilled wells built in the three companies' areas. As a result of the identification, there were 18 residents' wells that had dried up. Even though the well is used for the daily needs of local residents. \"Before it dries up, the residents use the well for bathing and washing, as well as meeting the water needs for making or for the production of red stone,\" said the resident of Papanloe Village.\n3. Companies at KIBA are considered disobeying and ignoring the rules\nFurthermore, Ardi explained, from the start of socialization by the government, companies at KIBA would prioritize recruiting local workers. The goal is that the people living around KIBA can improve their standard of living. But in practice, the company is considered to be in denial. Instead, they recruit more workers from outside. \"The company has not prioritized Papanloe residents in recruiting employees. Of the total number of employees as of October 2021, there were 1,255 people, while there were only 220 employees from Papanloe Village,\" said Ardi. Ardi added, residents have also taken various ways to submit their demands to the company. Starting from the village government to the local DPRD. \"But the problem really is with the company. Because it works without looking at the EIA, so there are a lot of impacts,\" he added. Confirmed separately, Community Development (Condev) PT. Huadi Nickel Alloy Indonesia Andi Rezky Darmawan Latippa said that his party had mediated the issue of residents' demands. \"We have received approximately 13 representatives from the community. The employee recruitment issue has been explained directly by our HRD manager,\" Rezky said in a written statement. Rezky said the environmental problems that residents complained about had also been explained to the local community. \"Our party has made several improvement efforts accompanied by the Ministry of Environment and Forestry and the Provincial Environmental Management Service in managing the environment based on applicable rules and laws,\" he said.\"\n\nEnvironmental Impact:\nShip movement has hurt seaweed cultivation; dust and waste pollution, water shortage due to company activities.\n\n(IDN Times, 3/24/2022, Sulsel.idntimes.com): Residents Protest the Impact of Bantaeng Industrial Estate Activities\n\"Hundreds of residents of Pa'jukukang District, Bantaeng Regency, South Sulawesi, feel they are victims of the impact of the activities of companies operating in the Bantaeng Industrial Area (KIBA)...\n2.

Some people living in the area told The AP their land was seized or they were facing pressure from PT KIPI and local officials to move, and offered unfair prices. PT KIPI did not respond to a request for comment. Residents hope the project may bring jobs, but worry they will lose their traditional livelihoods as fishermen, farmers and increasingly, eco-tourism hosts as dust and ash smother their fields. An analysis by CELIOS of PT KIPI’s environmental impact assessment forecasts the the problems will worsen once the project begins operating.\n“The effects of hot water waste contamination, coal-fired power plant fly ash, rising air temperatures, project smoke, noise, sea dredging, and spilt coal/fuel spills will cause the sea to become murky, which will cause tourism (industry) to decrease and the quality and quantity of (fish) catches to significantly decrease,” it said.\"\n\nEnvironmental Impact:\nEnvironmental groups in Indonesia and abroad have raised concerns and staged protests over the proposed building of new captive coal power plants for the industrial park. In Phase 1 and Phase 2 of KIPI’s development, Adaro plans to build approximately 1000 MW capacity of coal power plants in each phase, before the anticipated hydroelectric power plants are ready to operate. In February 2023, it was reported that Adaro was having trouble finding financing for the development of their coal power plants, as many international banks that Adaro had previously borrowed from had pledged to stop supporting new coal projects (ft.com, 2/6/2023). Environmental groups also called out Hyundai, who plans to use aluminum from the smelter for electric vehicle production, for violating its own carbon neutrality principles. At Adaro’s 2023 annual shareholders’ meeting in May, two of its own shareholders protested against the planned captive power plants (news.mongabay.com, 6/15/2023). Mongabay also reported that it is unlikely the captive coal plants will be shut down in 2030, once hydropower is available, as the master plan for KIPI designates a zone of the park that is permitted to use power from coal power plants (news.mongabay.com, 6/15/2023). In May 2023, Adaro had only secured funding from domestic Indonesian banks for the first phase of the coal power plant development (1,060 MW capacity).\n\n(AP News, 9/14/2023,apnews.com/): New Indonesian industrial park on Borneo, feted as ‘green,’ will be powered by coal, report says\n\"...The environmental impact assessment commissioned by PT Kalimantan Industrial Park Indonesia, which operates a large part of the current development, describes what is happening in the 15,000 hectare (32,100 acre) area, where plumes of dust mushroom into the sky along the Celebes Sea as heavy equipment fells trees and razes paddy fields.\nIt says the project’s coastal zone is a conservation and migration area for green turtles, hawksbill turtles and killer whales. Hawksbill turtles are listed as critically endangered by the International Union for Conservation of Nature, while green turtles are considered endangered.\nHis wooden boat rocking as excavators and construction trucks roar nearby, fisherman Erwin laments the constant ship traffic delivering supplies to the remote area.\n'We are looking for fish further and further away from the beach because there are lots of ships in the area driving fish away,' said Erwin, who like many Indonesians uses only one name. 'If (the industrial park) is built, I don’t know what the future holds but it’s clear that it will definitely have an impact (and) hurt my income.'\"\n\n(Mongabay, 6/15/2023, new.mongabay.com): Indonesian coal giant Adaro’s ‘sustainable’ smelter slammed as ‘greenwashing’\n\"Indonesia’s largest coal miner, PT Adaro Energy, faces claims of greenwashing over its plan to build coal-fired power plants on the island of Borneo to provide electricity for its aluminum smelter there.\nAt its annual shareholders’ meeting in Jakarta on May 11, two shareholders protested against the planned captive power plants, known as such because they’re designed specifically to supply certain industries and not to feed into the grid.\n“Stop the development of new coal plants. One billion people will be threatened by the climate crisis due to coal plants,” one of the shareholders shouted while being escorted out of the meeting.\nThe plants, with a combined capacity of 2.2 gigawatts, will supply Adaro’s aluminum smelter in an industrial park, itself branded as “green,” in North Kalimantan province. The park is being touted, once completed, as the largest of its kind in the world, home to Indonesia’s first electric vehicle battery production, alongside petrochemical and aluminum industries.\nThe smelter project, estimated to cost $2 billion, has entered the preconstruction phase and is expected to start commercial operation in 2025. Once running at full capacity in 2029, it will be able to produce 1.5 million metric tons of aluminum a year, the company says.\nAluminum is used in the lithium nickel-cobalt-aluminum oxide (NCA) cathodes that are the most widely cathodes currently found in EV batteries. Because of this, and the adjacent EV battery plant in the industrial park, Adaro is marketing the aluminum smelter project as a flagship green and renewable development for Indonesia.\n“Seeing the future development of electric vehicle (EV), the Company is ready to participate in providing aluminium for the EV’s material and support green economy for sustainable living,” Adaro said in a filing to the Jakarta stock exchange.\nBut building the smelter will start with building the coal-fired power plants to run them. Only later, in 2030, will the smelter switch to using power from a hydroelectric plant.\nAdaro said that while the main power source for the industrial park will be renewables, coal will still be needed in the initial stages of the smelter as it takes longer to build renewable power plants.\nBinbin Mariana, Southeast Asia energy finance campaigner at climate group Market Forces, noted that state-owned aluminum producer PT Indonesia Asahan Aluminium (Inalum) is also building a smelter in North Sumatra province — powered by two hydro plants.\n“By using hydropower plants, the cost of the aluminium production is much cheaper compared to using coal-fired power plants,” she said. “The cost if using hydropower is less than 5 U.S. cents per kilowatt-hour, compared to 6 to 8 U.S. cents if using coal.”\nAnd even after Adaro makes the switch in 2030, it’s not clear whether the captive coal plants will be decommissioned, according to the Center of Economic and Law Studies (CELIOS), a Jakarta-based research institute.\n“Is there any guarantee that when the hydropower plant is ready, the captive coal plants will be shut down? No,” CELIOS executive director Bhima Yudhistira said.\nHe added that’s because the master plan for the “green” industrial park explicitly allows coal power: the estate’s environmental impact assessment maps out two zones, green and blue, with factories and smelters in the blue zone permitted to use power from coal plants.\nEven using the best available technology to minimize emissions, the captive plants will still emit an estimated 5.2 million metric tons of greenhouse gases per year, according to Market Forces.\nGreenpeace Indonesia energy campaigner Bondan Andriyanu said this goes against the Indonesian government’s pledge to phase out coal and switch to renewables in a bid to mitigate climate change. The planned coal plants will also dash any hope of meeting the wider goal to limit global temperature rise to 1.5° Celsius (2.7° Fahrenheit) above pre-industrial levels.\nThe International Energy Agency says there can be no new coal-fired power plants after 2021 if the world is to stay within this threshold, agreed on by nations including Indonesia in the Paris climate pact to avoid the most catastrophic impacts of climate change.\n“The development of a new coal plant will only exacerbate the impact of the climate crisis, pollute the environment, harm the people and Indonesia’s commitment in reducing carbon emissions from the energy sector,” Bondan said.\nLess money for coal\nNabilla Gunawan, Indonesia campaigner for Market Forces, called the smelter project “greenwashing” since it’s being marketed as sustainable. With other environmental groups also pointing this out, Adaro has reportedly struggled to raise money from international banks to finance the project.\nThe company had planned to get $1.1 billion in bank loans to help meet the $2 billion price tag, but several global banks that had previously done business with Adaro now say they won’t finance the smelter. This includes Singapore’s DBS and OCBC, and the U.K.’s Standard Chartered.\nFor coal companies like Adaro, it’s becoming increasingly difficult to get funding as a growing number of banks and investment funds announce their commitments to tackling climate change by no longer funding industries that contribute to greenhouse gas emissions, according to Binbin of Market Forces.\nMany of these institutions are part of the U.N.’s Net-Zero Banking Alliance, accounting for about 40% of global banking assets. To date, 115 banks in 41 countries have joined the alliance.\nThat leaves a shrinking pool of banks willing to fund coal, especially for companies like Adaro, which not only plans to build new power plants, but also still has plans to prospect for new coal reserves, Binbin said.\n“What’s funny is that if you look at Adaro’s annual report in 2021, it says that they’re still exploring new mines,” she said.\nAdaro’s coal production hit a record high in 2022, amounting to 62.8 million metric tons, a 19% increase from the 52.7 million tons it mined in 2021, casting further doubt on the company’s commitment to transition away from coal.\nAdaro Minerals, the subsidiary in charge of the smelter project, has denied that the company is struggling to get funding for the project.\n“The rumor is not true,” Adaro Minerals director Wito Krisnahadi said as quoted by CNBC Indonesia, adding that they’ve been able to secure financing from at least five banks.\nWito declined to name the banks.\nAdaro Energy’s head of corporate communications, Febriati Nadira, said separately that the company is in the process of finalizing the deal to finance the project.\nAdaro Minerals has also denied allegations of greenwashing. President director Christian Ariano Rachmat said the company remains committed to transitioning toward green energy, but will need time to build the hydropower plant to meet the aluminum smelter’s demand for electricity.\nChristian also said that three-quarters of aluminum smelters around the world still use coal, hence Adaro’s case wasn’t an outlier.\n“One day, we want to produce green aluminium, but it needs time to get there, at least until our hydro [plant] is finished,” he said.\nHyundai driving into controversy\nBesides Adaro, critics have also gone after South Korean automobile giant Hyundai, which signed an agreement in November 2022 to buy aluminum from Adaro for its EV production. Hyundai described the aluminum as “green and low-carbon” because it would be produced using hydroelectric power, and thus would “accelerate” the transition to sustainable energy and help the company meet its net-zero emissions goal by 2045.\nBut the agreement fails to mention that hydropower will only come into the mix at a later stage, with the smelter initially relying on burning coal. That makes any purchase of aluminum from Adaro’s smelters a violation of Hyundai’s Carbon Neutrality Principles, Binbin said.\nThose principles require Hyundai to cut not just its own emissions, but also those emissions associated with assets it doesn’t own — like the aluminum it plans to buy from Adaro. These are known as Scope 3 emissions, and in 2022 Hyundai reported 18.3 million metric tons of Scope 3 emissions from its supply chain, up from 17 million metric tons in 2021.\n“This means that this 18 million tons of emissions have to be reduced,” Binbin said. “But if Hyundai buys aluminium from Adaro, the emissions [from its supply chain] will increase. So this doesn’t make any sense.”\nUPDATE: On 12 May 2023, the deal to finance the smelter project reached financial closing. A group of five Indonesian domestic banks – Mandiri Bank, Bank Negara Indonesia (BNI), Bank Central Asia (BCA), Bank Rakyat Indonesia (BRI), Permata Bank – provided a total of 2.5 trillion rupiah (US$166.8 million) and US$1.5 billion loans to Adaro’s smelter and coal power plant subsidiaries, Kalimantan Aluminium Industry (KAI), and Kaltara Power Indonesia (KPI).\"\n\n(Petrominer, 3/14/2023, Petrominer.com): Signed MoU with Adaro, Questioned Hyundai's Climate Commitment\n\"A coalition of environmental organizations from Indonesia and South Korea has raised concerns over the memorandum of understanding (MoU) signed by Hyundai Motor Company and PT Adaro Minerals Indonesia Tbk. The reason is that, based on the MoU, Hyundai can buy a maximum of 100,000 tons of aluminum per year from Adaro. Meanwhile, Adaro plans to build a new 1.1 GW coal-fired power plant as an energy source to produce aluminum.\nResponding to this problem, 10 environmental organizations from Indonesia and Korea have sent an objection letter to Hyundai on January 24, 2023. They also expressed their concerns over the cooperation plan, but until now Hyundai has not responded.\n\"We have expressed our concerns and sent a letter to Hyundai in January, but until now Hyundai has not updated our letter,\" said Campaigner from Market Forces, Nabilla Gunawan, Monday (13/3).\nAccording to Nabilla, this partnership with Adaro is in direct conflict with Hyundai's climate commitments. The reason is that Hyundai failed to take into account the consequences of building a new coal-fired power plant on the climate and environment.\n\"Hyundai has reneged on its commitment to environmentally friendly vehicles by using aluminum produced using a new coal-fired power plant,\" he said.\nEven though Adaro labels this aluminum smelter project as an 'environmentally friendly' project, the initial phase of the smelter will use electricity from a new coal fired power plant. In fact, the average PLTU in the world operates for 46 years, meaning that it will be difficult for Hyundai to achieve the carbon neutral target in 2045 if Hyundai still relies on aluminum produced from Adaro's coal energy.\n\"Electric vehicle consumers are increasingly skeptical that the goal of the energy transition is still littered with the massive use of coal,\" said Bhima Yudhistira from the Center of Economic and Law Studies (CELIOS).\nOn the previous occasion, the National Coordinator of the Mining Advocacy Network (JATAM), Melky Nahar, said that Indonesia does not need new coal-fired power plants which clearly pollute and damage the environment. Companies like Adaro have a history of destroying people's lives and have contributed to environmental disasters such as floods and landslides in Kalimantan.”\n“We were very concerned about Hyundai signing a memorandum of understanding to purchase aluminum produced by Adaro, when it became clear that the production would be supported by a new coal-fired power plant. Hyundai should not support dirty aluminum production by Adaro and encourage low-carbon investment in Indonesia,\" said Melky.\nCurrently, Adaro's aluminum smelter is known to have a planned capacity of 1.5 million tons per year in 2029. Adaro plans to rely on coal-fired power plants in the early stages, then add capacity from hydropower in the final stage.\"", "Sources": "https://infopublik.id/kategori/nusantara/701822/kunjungi-kipi-wabup-dan-tim-lakukan-evaluasi\nhttps://kilasdaerah.kompas.com/kalimantan-utara/read/2022/10/28/11450601/mengenal-lebih-dekat-perjalanan-kawasan-industri-raksasa-di-kaltara\nhttps://katadata.co.id/happyfajrian/ekonomi-hijau/633ff25058af9/kawasan-industri-akan-dipasok-listrik-ebt-demi-tingkatkan-nilai-produk\nhttps://korankaltara.com/7-investor-dikeluarkan-dari-kipi-tanah-kuning-mangkupadi\nhttps://korankaltara.com/kipi-dan-kihi-memiliki-pengertian-sama\nhttps://www.neraca.co.id/article/168461/bangun-smelter-aluminium-adaro-minerals-kuras-kocek-rp-163-triliun\nhttps://dephub.go.id/post/read/menhub-pastikan-kelancaran-perizinan-pembangunan-pelabuhan-kawasan-industri-kaltara\nhttps://katadata.co.id/tiakomalasari/berita/62b4346b08c50/pemerintah-kembangkan-kawasan-industri-di-kaltara-bakal-dihuni-ford\nhttps://www.teslarati.com/tesla-indonesia-battery-plant-location/\nhttps://www.industry.co.id/read/104950/teken-komitmen-investasi-capai-usd-728-juta-adaro-bakal-bangun-smelter-aluminium-di-kawasan-industri-hijau\nhttps://asia.nikkei.com/Economy/Indonesia-s-newest-province-chases-132bn-industrial-dream\nhttps://www.kompas.com/properti/read/2021/12/22/163000421/kawasan-industri-hijau-mulai-dibangun-di-kaltara-apa-itu-?page=2\nhttps://www.kominfo.go.id/content/detail/38900/presiden-groundbreaking-kawasan-industri-hijau-indonesia/0/berita\nhttps://www.fmprc.gov.cn/mfa_eng/wjdt_665385/wshd_665389/202211/t20221117_10976707.html\n(Archived link, 3/14/23) https://web.archive.org/web/20230314002433/https://petrominer.com/teken-mou-dengan-adaro-komitmen-iklim-hyundai-dipertanyakan/\nhttps://tanahair.net/kayan-river-hydropower-source-of-green-energy-at-kipi/\nhttps://www.reuters.com/business/energy/indonesia-president-breaks-ground-construction-26-bln-hydropower-plant-2023-03-01/\nhttps://www.ft.com/content/214da7e7-c858-452c-9aff-e6dab9b805e4\nhttps://news.mongabay.com/2023/06/indonesian-coal-giant-adaros-sustainable-smelter-slammed-as-greenwashing/\n(Archived link, 3/29/24) https://web.archive.org/web/20240329043346/https://www.adaro.com/files/news/berkas_eng/2206/Information%20Disclosure%20Signing%20Facility%20Agreements.pdf\n(Archived link, 102/23) https://web.archive.org/web/20231002215935/https://www.ptkhn.com/news/indonesia-president-joko-widodo-breaks-ground-on-construction-of-mentarang-induk-hydroelectric-plant-the-largest-plta-in-indonesia-with-a-capacity-of-1375-mw/\nhttps://asia.nikkei.com/Business/Energy/Japan-s-Sumitomo-joins-17.8bn-Indonesia-hydropower-project\nhttps://www.ft.com/content/1a8c599c-cd56-4b94-85fd-7d9d398312eb\nhttps://tanahair.net/kayan-hydro-energy-resuming-9000-mw-hydropower-project/\nhttps://www.business-humanrights.org/en/latest-news/indonesia-chinese-backed-hydropower-plant-supplying-electricity-to-new-capital-raises-displacement-and-environmental-concerns-among-indigenous-communities-on-kayan-river/\nhttps://apnews.com/article/indonesia-green-industrial-park-coal-09361a5098d6540d4ae3a1805b137788\nhttps://www.rfa.org/english/news/china/indonesia-china-borneo-03012023014556.html\nhttps://en.antaranews.com/news/274161/bulungan-kipi-future-of-green-industry-widodo\n(Broken) https://www.adaro.com/files/news/berkas_eng/2146/ADRO%20ADMR%20Sept%202022.pdf\n(Archived link, 3/29/24) https://web.archive.org/web/20240329043346/https://www.adaro.com/files/news/berkas_eng/2206/Information%20Disclosure%20Signing%20Facility%20Agreements.pdf\nhttps://www.apindokaltara.com/berita/read/kipi-akan-gandeng-pengusaha-lokal-kaltara\nhttps://www.gem.wiki/Adaro_Aluminum_Smelter_power_station\n(Archived link, 5/18/2024) https://web.archive.org/web/20240518022508/https://www.energytransitionpartnership.org/uploads/2022/09/The-Electricity-Infrastructure-Planning-and-Investment-Needs-to-Support-Energy-Transition.pdf\nhttps://www.reuters.com/business/energy/indonesia-president-breaks-ground-construction-26-bln-hydropower-plant-2023-03-01/" }, "geometry": { "type": "Point", "coordinates": [ 117.8590457, 2.528752567 ] } },

In terms of the HPT forest area land issue that was alleged to have been damaged by PT BAI, that is not true because we have made an application to the Ministry of Forestry. That the cut and fill area being carried out by PT BAI is currently has left the HPT area to become APL,\" he concluded.\"", "Sources": "https://www.gem.wiki/Nanshan_Industrial_Park_power_station\n(Broken) https://www.nickelmagazine.com/2022/04/smelter-industrial-area.html?m=1\nhttps://oss.go.id/informasi/lokasi-usaha?tab=kek&page=1\n(Archived link, 7/25/22) https://web.archive.org/web/20220725105712/https://www2.bkpm.go.id/id/publikasi/detail/berita/kek-galang-batang-olah-bauksit-jadi-alumina\nhttps://kepriprov.go.id/berita/pemprov-kepri/kek-galang-batang-dari-kepri-untuk-indonesia\nhttps://kepri.antaranews.com/berita/133953/pma-investasi-rp30-triliun-di-kek-galang-batang-bintan\nhttps://www.ekon.go.id/publikasi/detail/3605/presiden-joko-widodo-lepas-ekspor-perdana-tahun-2022-smelter-grade-alumina-di-kawasan-ekonomi-khusus-kek-galang-batang\nhttps://kepri.antaranews.com/berita/149316/realisasi-investasi-di-kek-galang-batang-bintan-mencapai-rp19-triliun\nhttps://m.batamtoday.com/berita-187713-DLHK-dan-ESDM-Kepri-Sebut-Cut-and-Fill-PT-BAI-di-Galang-Batang-Tak-Salahi-Aturan.html\nhttps://www.hariankepri.com/pt-bai-akan-bangun-industri-amunisi-di-bintan-dan-pltu-1-200-megawatt/\nhttps://www.alcircle.com/news/pln-agrees-to-supply-energy-to-pt-bintan-alumina-indonesia-until-2050-83509\nhttps://www.reuters.com/markets/commodities/shandong-nanshan-may-expand-indonesia-site-into-6-bln-aluminium-complex-2023-05-15/\n(Archived link, 5/18/2024) https://web.archive.org/web/20240518022508/https://www.energytransitionpartnership.org/uploads/2022/09/The-Electricity-Infrastructure-Planning-and-Investment-Needs-to-Support-Energy-Transition.pdf\nhttps://web.pln.co.id/cms/media/2022/09/dukung-sektor-pertambangan-pln-akan-suplai-listrik-hingga-2050-untuk-pt-bintan-alumina-indonesia/" }, "geometry": { "type": "Point", "coordinates": [ 104.6535905, 0.9204110377 ] } },

The community submitted a report document containing traces of environmental and humanitarian crimes from NCKL company’s operations in Kawasi, Obi Island, South Halmahera, North Maluku Province.\nThe Harita Group subsidiary is projected to gain an increase in net worth from USD 1.1 billion to USD 4.6 billion. This action was carried out to convey to brokers, as public intermediaries in buying and selling shares related to the dangers of investing in NCKL.\nPT Trimegah Bangun Persada Tbk (NCKL) is a subsidiary of Harita Group that operates the first High Pressure Acid Leaching (HPAL) smelter on Obi Island, North Maluku. The company produces 60,000 tons of nickel per year. HPAL technology will convert local low-grade ore into mixed hydroxide deposits, a form of nickel that can further be processed to make batteries.\nIn its operations, PT Trimegah Bagun Persada, along with PT Gane Sentosa Permai, PT Halmahera Persada Lygend, PT Megah Surya Pertiwi, and PT Halmahera Jaya Feronickel on Obi Island, all companies under the auspices of Harita Group, have devastated the land / plantation land of residents, polluted water sources, river water, and sea water, polluted the air due to dust and pollution that has an impact on the health of residents, to trigger social conflicts due to intimidation and repeated violence against residents who defend their living spaces. PT Trimegah Bangun Persada and  a number of other companies owned by Harita Group also unilaterally annexed residents’ land without fair negotiation and compensation.\n“Lili Mangundap and four other families who owned land in Kawasi village were annexed by the company. The company and the South Halmahera Regency government also plan to relocate Kawasi residents to Eco Village Housing, located 5 kilometers to the south of Kawasi. For residents, this relocation not only removes them from their homes, but also robs them of their cultural and historical values. Not only that, residents are also excluded from their sources of life such as land, fields, and the sea,” said Muhammad Jamil, Head of the Legal Division of JATAM Nasional.\nHarita Group’s mining operations resulted in polluted water sources of Kawasi residents and sedimentation of nickel ore from the company’s operations. Before the mine came in and operated, residents could get water for free, but now they have to spend money to get clean water. This condition makes it more difficult for residents who are economically deprived because they are forced to use polluted water sources. PT Trimegah Bangun Persada and other Harita Group-owned companies in the region dump waste into rivers and flow into the sea. This causes the coast and sea to turn cloudy-brownish. The marine ecosystem on Obi Island is damaged by sewage pipes leading to the sea. The fish that have been consumed by residents are also contaminated with heavy metals.\nIn addition to pollution in the sea, the company’s activities are so close to settlements, that residents are forced to deal with dust, noise, and a dirty environment. During the dry season, kitchen utensils, dining tables, chairs, floors, and even in the room are full of dust from company activities and coal dust. Based on information from residents and officials at Kawasi health clinic, acute respiratory infections (ARI) are the most important health problem in Kawasi. Most patients are toddlers. There were 124 infants aged 0-1 years who visited the health clinic from January to December 2021. Toddlers aged 1-5 years were recorded as many as 283, followed by the age group of 20-44 years as many as 179 people.\nIn addition to bringing health problems, Harita Group’s operations also ignore the OHS Compliance aspect of its workers. Throughout 2022, the mining and mineral processing sector dominated accidents in North Maluku, especially belonging to Harita Group. Based on media reports, in the 2019-2023 time frames, 8 cases were recorded with 2 victims died and 5 people were injured. This fact refutes Harita Group’s claim that there were no casualties due to work accidents. In nickel mining operations, Harita Group, through PT Halmahera Persada Lygend (HPL), also uses coal-fired power plants for operations. The total capacity of the coal-fired power plant is 210 MW. PT HPL is a joint venture between Harita Group and Ningbo Lygend from China which has around 2,030 MW of coal-fired power plants in the process of construction and pre-permitting. The company also targets a total of 4,200 MW of coal-fired power plants on Obi Island. The construction of the power plant violates the commitment of Chinese President, Xi Jinping, through his speech in 2021, which stated that he would not build new power plants abroad.\n“With all the environmental and social damage made by Harita Group, the company has underwriters, namely Credit Suisse Group, BNP Paribas, Citigroup, Mandiri Sekuritas, DBS, OCBS Securities, and UOB Kay Hian. six underwriters from Harita Group companies -except Mandiri Sekuritas, are members of the Net-Zero Banking Alliance. Their collaboration with Harita Group certainly undermines GFANZ’s commitment itself in supporting the achievement of zero emission targets and a just clean energy transition,” said Novita Indri, a campaigner from Trend Asia.\"\n\n(Indoprogress, 1/14/2023, indoprogress.com): Details unfair land compensation case of Lily Mangudap, environmental degradation and pollution of water sources, increased resident health problems, lack of access to electricity, forced relocation\n\n(Mongabay, 12/9/2022, mongabay.co.id/2022/12/09): Surrounded by Nickel Industry, Kawasi Residents Face Environmental Problems, Protest Village Relocation\n-  \"The community consisting of religious leaders, traditional leaders, village government and cross-organizations approached the South Halmahera DPRD, questioning the news about the Kawasi Village relocation plan after the nickel mining company, PT Harita Group, began operating on Obi Island.

This project was invested with Ningbo Lygend Resources Technology and Indonesia Harita Group.\nThe coal-fired power plant project with a capacity of 4×380 MW is build to support the laterite nickel ore smelter project which is also located on Obi Island. The first phase of the project includes the construction and installation of the system. The target is that the CPP is claimed to supply energy sources for the development of nickel smelters as raw materials for the battery industry...This project also has a negative impact on the people living around the project area. Lily Mangundap, as in her interview in Project Multatuli, said that this nickel smelter industry project had slowly “killed” her and her family. The company PT Trimegah Bangun Persada, a subsidiary of the Indonesia Harita Group, forcibly evicted its plantation land to expand its concession by building a nickel smelter. The land that was Lily’s source of livelihood disappeared and turned into the Obi Island Industrial Estate, which produces nickel ore as the raw material for batteries for electric vehicles.\"\n\n(Mongabay, 11/14/2021, mongabay.co.id,): \" Obi Island, in South Halmahera, North Maluku, has built a nickel downstream industrial area and built a factory for the production of electric vehicle battery raw materials. From nickel mines to smelter factories there. The environment and people's lives have changed...\nThe hills that used to be green have now turned into buildings and industrial area facilities. Several coal-fired power plants (PLTU) units have been built to support industrial area energy.\n How about the fate of the surrounding environment and residents? The rivers to the shores of the sea also changed color, from clear to reddish. Not to mention the dust that fills the settlements during the dry season. Residents' lives have shifted from farmers and fishermen to laborers in the mining industry.\nLand problems also occurred between residents and companies. Gardens with various living plants were displaced. Some residents persist, do not want their living land to become a company area. They do not want to accept compensation with a value that residents consider far from appropriate. The couple Lily and Andrias' land, for example, has an area of ​​33 hectares with tens of thousands of coconut, cashew and other plantations to be valued at IDR 38 million.\n\nEnvironmental Impact:\nEnvironmental degradation, health problems for local residents, resident loss of access to clean water, forced relocation, potential improper waste disposal\n\n(Washington Post, 5/10/2023 washingtonpost.com): To meet EV demand, industry turns to technology long deemed hazardous\n\"...One afternoon late last year, Liyus, a 52-year-old farmer on Obira, walked along the coast where his family has lived for four generations. It’s been quiet on this island for most of his life. Without a private jet, getting to Obira from the Indonesian capital, Jakarta, is at least a two-day journey involving an overnight ferry and hours of driving on roads stippled with potholes.\nLiyus, who goes by one name, said he used to drink from the rivers that run past his village, but since the nickel mine added its acid-leaching refinery two years ago, the waterways have turned dark red, so thick with pollution at some points that rows of coconut trees have been killed off. He doesn’t know what’s in the water, only that it bleeds into the sea and that his nephews have had to go farther and farther out to find fish. He pointed to a fishing net drying on a nearby tree. It was stained a reddish brown.\nIn an hour-long interview, representatives from the two companies that jointly own the processing plant on Obira island — an Indonesian firm, Harita Group, and a Chinese firm, Lygend Resources — said that the operation has not had a negative impact on the environment and that the pollution along the coast was not related to waste produced by their plant. All of their operations, they emphasized, are in “full compliance” with government requirements. “We looked at what was the best and we confirmed it with the government,” said Tonny Gultom, Harita’s head of health, safety and environment...\nThe nickel mine on Obira has been operated by Harita since 2016, but in 2018, Lygend joined to plan, design and construct the HPAL refinery, eventually acquiring a majority stake in the project. The processing facility, which was designated a priority for the national government, opened in 2021.\nAfter the companies withdrew their initial plan to dump the HPAL waste into the sea, they told authorities that they would store the waste on land, drying out the acidic slurry before dumping it back into the mining pit, and then treating the residue water in a tailings “pond.”\nOnly a year earlier, however, Harita executives had published a research article in a science journal stating that land disposal on Obira is actually “less suitable” because the region is in a notoriously active seismic zone — as recently as 2019, a 7.2-magnitude earthquake devastated a port town on Bacan island, less than 50 miles from Obira — and is frequently visited by heavy rainfall. That article also noted that about 7,000 villagers lived downstream from the site, concluding that the construction and water control required for land disposal was “not feasible.”\nAsked about those findings, a Harita spokesman acknowledged that storing the waste on land is dangerous but said the company is managing the risks by drying out the slurry and dumping it back into the mining pit, where it is prevented from seeping into local waterways.\nBut a foreign mining consultant who has been working on projects in Indonesia for more than two decades said: “It’s a massive heap of waste. And if it’s not stored properly, you can have landslides. That’s my biggest concern.” He spoke on the condition of anonymity because of business considerations...\nFour international mining experts independently reviewed photos of the mining site at Obira taken by The Washington Post. The experts said that it was impossible without a formal audit to ascertain whether Harita and Lygend were dumping HPAL tailings into the sea, but that there were multiple signs that the companies were generally failing to contain mining waste.\nThe photos show “devastating” levels of deforestation, which can increase the risks of tailings accidents, said Aimee Boulanger, executive director of the Initiative for Responsible Mining Assurance, an organization that audits mining operations and measures them against social and environmental standards. Even if tailings were not being actively pumped into the sea, there don’t appear to be “any significant controls” over what’s flowing out of the mine and entering waterways, she added.\nSam Riggall, an advocate of responsible mining and the chief executive of Sunrise Energy Metals, an Australian nickel and cobalt mining company, said the material entering the rivers around the mining facility resembled processed waste, rather than just runoff from open-pit mines...\nGultom, Harita’s head of safety, acknowledged that the HPAL refinery was producing a “huge volume” of waste that could pose safety risks if not properly managed, but he stressed that it was being handled with adequate precautions.\nThe discolored water near Obira’s coast, he said, was caused by sedimentation created by timber mining years ago. “It has nothing,” Gultom said, “to do with us.”\nHarita, which debuted on the Jakarta stock exchange in April, plans to add a second processing plant on Obira next year, company executives said.\"\n\n(Indoprogress, 1/14/2023, indoprogress.com): Details unfair land compensation case of Lily Mangudap, environmental degradation and pollution of water sources, increased resident health problems, lack of access to electricity, forced relocation\n\n(Mongabay, 12/9/2022,ww.mongabay.co.id/2022/12/09/): Surrounded by Nickel Industry, Kawasi Residents Face Environmental Problems, Protest Village Relocation\n-  \"The community consisting of religious leaders, traditional leaders, village government and cross-organizations approached the South Halmahera DPRD, questioning the news about the Kawasi Village relocation plan after the nickel mining company, PT Harita Group, began operating on Obi Island.

The state-owned mining company that has been reaping annual net profit of around Rp1.15 trillion, has also been dumping waste from its nickel mining operations high up on the hill, to the coast.\nThe waste released by the company that has been operating there since 2006, has now covered and polluted the bottom of the coastal area. Anas says that the place where he is now standing, was once teeming with corals, a habitat for fishes and other marine life.\nHis father, who was a fisherman from Sulawesi and moved to the area under the government’s sponsored transmigration program in the 1980s, often recounted that there used to be so many fishermen working in Moronopo Bay but now no more.\n“The mackerels which are commonly consumed by people were a staple. But now their habitat has been destroyed,” Anas said during an interview in mid-May.\nThe Moronopo Bay is administratively located in Soasangaji village, in the Kota Maba sub-district of East Halmahera, North Maluku. It takes five hours to reach the area from Sofifi, the main town in North Maluku.\nThe East Halmahera Environment Agency has noted that the waste sedimentation had covered an area of four hectares. At the farthest point from the coastline, about 100 meters from the source of the waste disposal, the waste layer, consisting of mud and rock, rises up to almost one meter from the beach surface.\nThe company tried to cover the waste by planting mangroves but Anas said it was a failed attempt as the waste continued to flow into the bay and the mangrove could not survive, in contrast to the naturally grown mangroves in the area.\nIn one corner where mangrove seedlings had just been planted, a board that says “PT Antam Mangrove Planting Conservation” sticks out from the ground. The board also indicates the first mangrove was planted in 2009.\n“So, these mangroves were planted in hopes to reduce the impacts of the waste pollution and it has been done several times, but they are still a far cry from the massive scale of their mining activities,” Anas said.\nThe worsening condition of the Moronopo bay is what prompted local residents to hold a protest on April 7, 2021, demanding that Antam cease all its mining activities. There was no response from the company.\nThe nickel mining operation on top of the hill in the Moronopo Bay area, is part of a mining concession owned by Antam and will expire in 2040. The concession of some 39,000 hectares, or more than half of the surface of the nation’s capital, Jakarta, straddled two subdistricts – Maba and Kota Maga.\nAntam is also mining nickel in Tanjung Buli, Maba subdistrict, since 2001; and in Pakal Island, in Kota Maba subdistrict, since 2011.\nIn 1998, Antam started mining nickel in Gee Island, Maba. The island has entered rehabilitation phase, although remnants of exploitation of the area remain evident.\nIn 2012, Antam also built a nickel refinery in Tanjung Buli but this facility is not yet in operation, while the permit will expire in 2032.\nThe company that was established not long after the establishment of the New Order, has been exploiting mineral in these two subdistricts of East Halmahera for more than two decades.\"\n\n(Tandaseru, 4/7/2021, tandaseru.com ): 2 Meters of Mud on the Shoreline, East Halmahera Residents Demonstrate Antam\n\"A number of residents of East Halmahera Regency , North Maluku Province, staged an action at the Moronopo mining site owned by PT Aneka Tambang, Wednesday (7/4).\nThis is because local residents think that Antam is not serious about handling mining waste which has caused the nearby coast to be filled with 2 meters of mud.\nThis action was led by Kapita Sangaji Maba Haltim, Ibrahim Haruna. This action was triggered by public unrest who accused Antam of polluting the environment with its mining waste.\n\"Because this mining location has practically been active for years, but until now in handling environmental pollution there has been no seriousness from Antam itself,\" said Udin, one of the demonstrators.\nThe demonstrators also demanded that mining activities in Moronopo be stopped before fixing environmental pollution at that location.\n“Environmental problems in Moronopo have been going on for decades. So we, the people who attended, hoped that this would not be considered a trivial matter, because when we dived on the beach the mud was more than 2 meters. It means that this mining location has to be moved, bearing in mind that PT Antam's mining area is large,\" continued Udin.\nMeanwhile, Kapita Sangaji, Ibrahim Haruna, in front of members of the East Halmahera DPRD and the company, who at that time also immediately checked the location, said that seeing the waste at the Moronopo mining site which had not been handled so far, the government and DPRD were expected to take steps to deal with the waste that had have piled up on the beach.\n\"So the government and DPRD are trying to pay attention to this waste, because this is a matter of the needs of the people of Haltim,\" he said.\nThe demonstrators also promised to continue to oversee the process of improving environmental pollution. If PT Antam does not take this matter seriously, a boycott will be carried out at the mining site.\"", "Sources": "https://www.antam.com/uploads/proyek-pengembangan-antam.pdf\nhttps://www.antam.com/en/news-and-events/article/perkembangan-penyelesaian-proyek-pabrik-feronikel-haltim---\nhttps://www.idnfinancials.com/news/45587/antam-sets-haltim-ferronickel-plant-operation-h\nhttps://www.tandaseru.com/2021/04/07/lumpur-setinggi-2-meter-di-bibir-pantai-warga-halmahera-timur-demo-antam/\nhttps://www.ekuatorial.com/en/2021/07/east-halmahera-fishermen-face-the-brunt-of-environmental-degradation/\nhttps://www.ekuatorial.com/en/2021/07/electric-vehicle-dream-is-costing-east-halmahera-its-environment/\nhttps://www.antam.com/id/news-and-events/article/construction-of-east-halmahera-feronickel-project-begins\nhttps://web.pln.co.id/media/siaran-pers/2023/01/pasok-llistrik-untuk-produksi-nikel-pt-antam-di-halmahera-timur-pln-berhasil-relokasi-pembangkit-dan-siap-beroperasi\nhttps://www.halmaheranesia.com/2023/09/07/terancamnya-mata-air-wato-wato-halmahera-dari-industri-tambang/\nhttps://antam.com/en/information-transparency/development-projects\n(Archived link, 8/8/22) https://web.archive.org/web/20220808214234/https://www.fht-antam.com/page/operasional-1\nhttps://indonesiabusinesspost.com/risks-opportunities/antam-first-metal-tapping-at-halmahera-timur-feronickel-plant-unveiled/\nhttps://www.gem.wiki/East_Halmahera_power_station\nhttps://www.hariankepri.com/pt-bai-akan-bangun-industri-amunisi-di-bintan-dan-pltu-1-200-megawatt/\nhttps://www.alcircle.com/news/pln-agrees-to-supply-energy-to-pt-bintan-alumina-indonesia-until-2050-83509\nhttps://www.tandaseru.com/2021/04/07/lumpur-setinggi-2-meter-di-bibir-pantai-warga-halmahera-timur-demo-antam/ " }, "geometry": { "type": "Point", "coordinates": [ 128.2494734, 0.8430947606 ] } },

In addition, IHIP has been accused by local residents and activists, including the Central Sulawesi WALHI chapter, of seizing a community road and building a PLTU without proper permits and socialization of environmental impact assessments (AMDAL). In summer 2024, local activists blocked the Topogaro Farm Road in protest of the company seizing the road. In July 2024, activists from the United Ambunu Forum of West Bungku District, Morowali Regency and WALHI Central Sulawesi chapter issued a complaint to the National Human Rights Commission (Komnas HAM) and the Ombudsman over the IHIP’s claim of Topogaro Farm road. In August 2024, IHIP sued four village residents in August 2024 for blocking the road.

They have been reported to the Court for blocking the production road within PT IHIP and demanded to compensate a material loss of Rp4.3 billion (US$277,000) following three days of idle production as a result of three days of road blockade in early June 2024.\nThe villagers bocked the road in the wake of a video footage circulated by Cipto Rustianto, an External Legal Staff of PT IHIP, declaring the disputed road is the legal property of PT IHIP based on the Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) of asset swap with the Regent of Morowali.\nThe Topogaro farm road, which is now the production road within PT IHIP, long before the existence of a nickel company, was used by the local community as a dirt path.\n“It served as the villagers’ access to the Topogaro Cave (cultural site) and coffe and cocoa plantations as well as rice fields,” Wandi, a campaigner for Central Sulawesi Chapter of the Indonesian Environmental Forum (WALHI), said in a statement on Monday, August 19, 2024.\nThe community’s anger over the unilateral claim of the farm road by the company extended to neighboring Ambunu Village, whose residents have had to detour and take a longer distance to travel as the farm road had converted into company buildings and warehouses.\n“Until now, PT IHIP has never shown the MoU on the asset swap agreement. Amid the villagers’ blockade of production road, PT BTIIG has launched seven legal attempts to criminalize the residents, ranging from subpoenas, police summonses, to lawsuits,” Wandi said.\nHe added that unilateral claim of the farm road possession by the company was not the only atrocity allegedly committed by the company.\n“There have been efforts by PT IHIP to silence the community fighting for their rights. There was also forced eviction of 14 hectares of productive oil palm land belonging to 12 families of Ambunu Village on October 17, 2022 without the knowledge of the owners,” Wandi said.\nPT BTIIG is a nickel smelter-based management company located within PT IHIP industrial zone. PT IHIP’s share composition consists of Zhensi Indonesia Industrial Park with 51percent, Beijing Shengyue Oriental Invesment Co., Ltd with 10.28 percent, PT Kejayaan Emas Persada 27.45percent, and PT Himalaya Global Investment 11.27 percent, with an investment value of Rp14 trillion rupiah. The 20,000-hectare industrial zone is located in the villages of Wata, Tondo, Ambunu, Topogaro, Upanga, Larebonu and Wosu. The development is part of a pilot zone for high-quality international cooperation under the “One Belt, One Road Initiative.”\n\n(Indonesia Business Post, 7/30/2024, indonesiabusinesspost.com): Local community complains about farm road grab case in Morowali\n\"A dozen of resident representatives grouped under the United Ambunu Forum of West Bungku District, Morowali Regency, along with activists of the Indonesian Forum for the Environment (WALHI) Central Sulawesi chapter, have complained to the National Human Rights Commission (Komnas HAM) and the Ombudsman over the claim made by a Chinese nickel smelter company on a farm road in the regency.\nThey went to the Ombudsman’s Central Sulawesi Office on July 25, 2024. On the following day, they went to the office of the Central Sulawesi chapter of Kommnas HAM to file a letter of complaint against a Memorandum of Agreement on asset swaps and other criminal acts allegedly conducted by PT Indonesia Huabao Industrial Park.\n“The letter contains chronology of the incidents, history of farm road, coordinate points, the decree by the Morowali regency administration that annuls the MOU on asset swaps and minutes of Morowali regency legislative council hearing,” Wandi, a campaigner for WALHI’s Central Sulawesi chapter, said.\nLocal community has launched the protest in the last two months. They blocked farm road claimed by PT Indonesia Huabao Industrial Park until the Morowali regency legislative council hearing on July 14, 2024 that failed to reach a settlement agreement. The ensuing annulment by the Morowali regency legislative council on the MoU, however, was apparently ignored by PT Indonesia Huabao Industrial Park, which then established a smelter and nickel ore warehouse on the road.\n“We are disappointed because the loss of people’s living space and the fact that the company’s presence impoverishes the people slowly under the pretext that nicklel investment will encourage an increase of people’s welfare,” Ramadhan, chairman of the United Ambunu Forum, said in a statement on Tuesday, July 30, 2024.\nThe Central Sulawesi chapter of WALHI accuses the Morowali regency administration and the Central Sulawesi provincial administration have ignored the people’s basic rights and prioritized the interest of the company by rolling out red carpet for land grabbing,” Wandi said.\n“Therefore, we ask the Komnas HAM to protect the activists and the people living around PT Indonesia Huabao Industrial Park. We also ask the Ombudsman to review the MOU between the Morowali administration and PT Indonesia Huabao Industrial Park on asset swaps and the Central Sulawesi administration to return the farm road ownership back to the people,” he added.\"\n\n(Mongabay, 7/5/2024, mongabay.co.id): Affected Communities Protest IHIP Nickel Industrial Area Project in Morowali\n\"The nickel industrial area development project, PT Indonesia Huabao Industrial Park (IHIP) in Bungku Barat District, Morowali, Central Sulawesi (Sulteng) was marred by agrarian conflict. In the end, four residents had to deal with the law because of the road blockade action to stop the company's activities.\nThe story goes, on March 11, 2024, residents of Tondo and Topogaro Villages. blocked the road that the company unilaterally claimed as the company's hauling road. The residents were furious and built tents in the middle of the road to stop production activities.\nWandi, a campaigner for Walhi Central Sulawesi, said that the blockade began when a video circulated of a statement from Riski, an external legal representative of IHIP, stating that the current farm road was a company road legally owned by IHIP.\nThe unilateral claim is based on a memorandum of understanding (MoU) for asset exchange with the Morowali Regent. In return, IHIP worked on expanding the airport. In fact, the road is the main access for the community to their land, such as coffee, cocoa, and rice fields. The road also leads to a cultural site, Topogaro Cave.\nThe MoU that the company and the regent made was not known to the public at all, there was no notification or socialization. Suddenly, the farm road had become a company road.\nPublic access to the gardens is also disrupted due to the activity of heavy equipment passing by every day.\n The unilateral claim also sparked public anger that spread to Ambunu Village, a village around IHIP. On June 15, residents of Ambunu Village also joined the road blockade, right next to the IHIP flyover , where ore, coal, and smelter storage warehouses have been built.\n\"The road blockade action by residents of Ambunu Village was attended by approximately 500 people spread across three points,\" he said.\nThe demands of the West Bungku residents are asking the Morowali Government to cancel the MoU. They also want to see the MoU in the hands of the company, but IHIP is reluctant to show the document, instead saying that the document is confidential.\nInstead of responding to the demands of the community, said Wandi, IHIP actually issued a warning to the blockade action movers. The first warning was given to four residents of Tondo and Topogaro Villages for the June 11 action. The warning was given to Rahman Ladanu, Wahid/Imran, Hamdan, and Safaat. The four people were also reported to the Central Sulawesi Regional Police.\nNot only that, said Wandi, IHIP also made a second warning to five residents of Ambunu Village for the blockade and barricading actions that resulted in the company's activities stopping on June 15. These five people are Moh Haris Rabbie, Makmur Ms, Abd Ramdhan, Hasrun, and Rifiana MS.\n\"So, there were 9 people summoned by IHIP, four were reported to the Central Sulawesi Regional Police.\"\nThe Morowali government finally canceled the MoU. The decision was taken at a meeting between the community, the company, and the Morowali government, along with Forkopimda elements, on June 22.\nThe company remains adamant that the MoU is still valid because the cancellation was unilateral.\nHowever, Wandi said, the cancellation of the MoU still confused residents. Because, based on the official release of IHIP and the Morowali Regional Government, the MoU was signed on December 22, 2023.\nIn the minutes of the cancellation of the MoU received by the public, the MoU that was cancelled refers to the MoU dated March 11, 2024.\n\"Both MoUs use the phrase 'use of assets' while in the widely circulated video the MoU read by IHIP's external legal team uses the phrase 'exchange assets'. Are there any other MoUs?\" he asked.\nRifiana MS, a resident of Ambunu Village who attended the company's summons, said that the Morowali Government seemed to be playing around with the community's demands because it seemed to be taking sides and protecting the company's interests.\nHe said, the Morowali Government wanted to try to stop their movement, without a clear agreement.\nThe reconciliation efforts mediated by the Morowali Government did not find a bright spot, instead the debate became more massive. The unilateral claims explained by the Morowali Regional Government could not answer the demands of the community. The Morowali Government, he said, continued to insist on stopping the road blockade movement.\n\"We were asked to stop our action, however, we still refused and continued the action with the demand to cancel the MoU,\" said Rifiana in a press conference at the end of June.\nIn addition to canceling the MoU, he said, residents asked for the road status to be handed over to the community. They also questioned the procedures of the Morowali Government to dare to hand over the road to IHIP.\n\"If our demands are not heeded by the Morowali Government, we will blockade the farm road again. We believe that the farm road belongs to the community, not the company.\"\n Cipto Rustianto, External Manager of IHIP denied all accusations from the public. The company, he said, is the result of coordination and approval from the central and regional governments, in accordance with applicable regulations. He claims that he has never encroached on people's farm roads, and is ready to prove it with data and facts.\nCipto also denied criminalizing citizens. He said the accusation of criminalization was baseless. So far, they have been committed to protecting the interests of the community in economic activities according to applicable laws. The company, he said, is trying to embrace the community through village governments and related institutions. \"Therefore, I invite all parties to respect the ongoing legal process and hand over the handling to the competent authorities,\" said Cipto as quoted in Media Alkhairaat .\nIHIP is an Indonesian company with Chinese capital. The stock composition consists of Zhensi Indonesia Industrial Park 51%, Beijing Shengyue Oriental Investment Co., Ltd 10.28%, PT Kejayaan Emas Persada 27.45%, and PT Himalaya Global Investment 11.27%...\nIn Indonesia, the parent company of Zhensi Holding Group to build the IHIP area is PT Bahosua Taman Industri Investment Grup (BTIIG). This industrial area is located in seven villages in Morowali Regency, namely; Topogaro Village, Wata, Ambunu, Tondo, Umpanga, Larobenu, and Wosu. This Rp14 trillion investment project will be built on an area of ​​around 20,000 hectares.\nIHIP and BTIIG will build this industrial area with a two-stage scheme. First , build 1,200 hectares in Ambunu, Topogaro, and Tondo which are currently problematic because the claim for the farm road was made unilaterally. Second , build 18,800 hectares in five other villages…\nCovert land grabbing\nThe project, which is claimed to be part of the energy transition work, is actually eroding the surrounding community. Land and roads that are the main access for people to farm and earn a living are seized in various ways and trigger agrarian conflicts.\nYusman, Walhi Sulteng Campaigner said, what happened in Ambunu Village, Topogaro, and Tondo was not the first agrarian conflict. In Morowali, it has been massive since the nickel company took root exploiting natural resources. The modes of land grabbing are also varied, including IHIP smoothing their project in extracting the earth's contents, one of which is the wrong eviction mode. IHIP once took 14 hectares of productive oil palm land from Ambunu residents with the wrong eviction mode at night on October 17, 2022.\nWhen the community protested, Yusman said, the company immediately offered compensation. This condition left farmers with no other choice but to accept compensation. In 2020, he said, IHIP was also suspected of filling in irrigation channels for mining roads that affected 170 hectares of rice fields belonging to 20 families.\nThe filling of the irrigation channels caused the rice fields to no longer be productive. The company took advantage of the moment to immediately negotiate by offering to buy the community's rice fields. Currently, he said, of the 170 hectares of community rice fields, only 10 hectares are still being managed.\n\"The filling of the irrigation channel changed the river channel and 36 hectares of community rice fields were submerged in water,\" said Yusma.\nNot only that. The IHIP reclamation to build a special jetty terminal covering 40 hectares in Tondo and Ambunu Villages has caused 115 seaweed fishermen to lose their livelihoods. In fact, he said, the reclamation did not have a permit and had been sealed by the Directorate General of PSDKP for violating Law 32/2009.\nIn addition, there is an allegation that IHIP does not have an industrial area business permit (IUKI) and an environmental permit (amdalalin). In fact, the company has currently built three captive PLTUs with a capacity of 350 MW, a smelter stockpile ore there.\nYusman urged that the MoU for the exchange of farm road assets in Topogaro and Ambunu Villages be completely cancelled. He also asked the company to stop criminalizing four Topogaro and Tondo residents. He also urged the Morowali DPRD to take action on the unilateral claim of the IHIP farm road through the MoU. The relevant ministry, he said, must also evaluate and provide a moratorium on the IHIP because the development of the nickel industry does not have a permit for the area and environment, as well as examine the Acting Regent of Morowali.\n“Stop the practice of covert land grabbing and ask the government for supervision.”\"\n\nEnvironmental Impact:\n\n(Mongabay, 7/5/2024, mongabay.co.id): Affected Communities Protest IHIP Nickel Industrial Area Project in Morowali\n…Covert land grabbing\nThe project, which is claimed to be part of the energy transition work, is actually eroding the surrounding community.

Indonesia Huabao Industrial Park (  PT. IHIP ) or PT. Bahosuo Taman Industri Investment Group (  PT. BTIIG ) in Bungku Barat District, Morowali Regency, Central Sulawesi.\nThe demands voiced related to the construction of the Steam Power Plant (PLTU) where the Sutet poles and cables cross through densely populated residential areas. Including the impact of pollution that will be caused later after the PLTU has been operating. Because, there are several villages that are directly affected, namely Topogaro Village, Ambunu Village, Tondo Village, and Wata Village.\nTherefore, GMKI held a meeting in Wata Village on Saturday (6/1/2024), discussing the possible impacts that will be borne by residents in the industrial area after the operation of the PLTU along with the construction and stretching of SUTET cables that cross densely populated settlements.\nThe results of the meeting were then agreed upon by a number of representatives of residents who were present, then the points of agreement were read out by Wajir Muhaimin as the chairman of GMKI Morowali Regency.\nThe 11 points of demands read out by Wajir were:\n1. Construction of PLTU location without socialization of Environmental Impact Analysis (Amdal)\n2. Illegal mining without a permit\n3. Land grabbing of local residents\n4. Land compensation that has not been completed\n5. Destruction of community facilities of fishermen without compensation.\n6. Termination of Employment Contracts and unilateral termination of employment (PHK) for local residents\n7. Closing space for local companies\n8. There is no good planning from the company regarding the spatial planning of the company's environment with residential areas and the distance between residents.\n9. The PLTU high-voltage power cables pass above residents' houses\n10. There are bad activities from companies crowding foreign citizens with fellow Chinese\n11. Meanwhile, Indonesian citizens (WNI) are stepchildren.\nThe 11 points of demands were then increased by 6 points, becoming seventeen points based on the aspirations of the residents' representatives who attended the meeting.\nThe points in question are,\n1. There is no clarity regarding compensation for affected communities.\n2. Immediately relocate and resolve the issue of compensation for residents' houses crossed by the PLTU cables and high-voltage power lines.\n3. Compensation and relocation of people's homes close to the PLTU due to radiation hazards is mandatory\n4. The companies PT. IHIP and PT. BTIIG are suspected of not accepting local residents as security employees, as if they wanted to pit locals against people from outside the region, when this investment should be guarded by local people.\n5. Urge PT. IHIP or PT. BTIIG to show the national Traffic Impact Analysis permit\n6. PT. IHIP or PT. BTIIG will immediately compensate the seaweed farmers of Pebotoa Village.\nIn the meeting, it was also revealed that the reason why residents calling themselves GMKI Morowali held a meeting was because PT IHIP or PT BTIIG was building a PLTU but had never socialized its AMDAL to residents in the industrial area.\n\"PT. IHIP or PT. BTIIG today is building a PLTU and has never conducted socialization regarding environmental impact analysis, the question is why Pebotoa village can receive impact compensation but has never been socialized,\" he said.\nTherefore, GMKI held a meeting to try to minimize arbitrary actions by companies so that they do not continue to occur against residents around the mining area.\nWajir continued, for the initial target, his party will immediately block PT. BTIIG's access to the Play Offair and give a speech in front of the PT. IHIP or PT. BTIIG company office.\nIn the same place, as a member of Ambunu Village, Ahmad hopes that GMKI will truly fight for the aspirations of the people in the industrial circle, not merely for personal interests. \"Then if we look for mistakes and problems with the presence of PT  . IHIP , we don't need to look for them, they are all already in our own heads,\" he said.\nAhmad, said that regarding the issue of licensing, the company must first socialize the AMDAL to the local community, starting from the village level, sub-district level and district level…\"\n\nWorker's rights dispute:\nWorked killed while processing nickel ore at IHIP from hot calcine dust.\n(Mongabay, 8/24/2024, mongabay.co.id): Another Death, Why Do Work Accidents in Nickel Factories Keep Repeating?\n\"- Workers or laborers experience work accidents in factories in the nickel industrial area in Central Sulawesi, continuously recurring. This time, workers of PT Indonesia Huabao Industrial Park (IHIP) or PT Baoshuo Taman Industri Investment Group (BTIIG) experienced a work accident while processing nickel ore, August 18 in Morowali Regency, Central Sulawesi. One worker died. The temporary suspicion is that this incident occurred due to hot calcine dust from the disposal.\n- Henry Foord Jebs, Chairman of the Morowali Mining and Energy Industry Workers Union (SBIPE), regretted the minimal accountability of the company in accidents, including last year's major explosion. The company should have been audited by an independent team involving the labor union.\n- Trend Asia notes that from 2015-2023, there were 93 work accidents at nickel smelters in Indonesia. ITSS, the highest contributor to worker deaths, was involved in the explosion incident in December 2023 that resulted in 21 deaths and 30 injuries.\n- In line with research from China Labor Watch (CLW) published on December 22, 2023. The report investigated the nickel production plan by delving into labor practices at Indonesia's largest nickel production industry project backed by Chinese capital. The report said that for almost a decade, horrific workplace deaths have continued to occur in the nickel industry in Indonesia. Substandard safety practices are the main cause of a series of accidents and deaths in the workplace.\"", "Sources": "https://www.gem.wiki/PT_IHIP_power_station\nhttps://www.asianmetal.com/news/1856491/Hanrui-Cobalt-to-build-60,000-metal-ton-nickel-high-pressure-leaching-project-in-Indonesia-Huabao-Industrial-Park \nhttps://zhejiang.chinadaily.com.cn/jiaxing/2023-05/25/c_889770.htm \nhttp://en.zhenshigroup.com/news/436.html\nhttps://www.tribunnews.com/bisnis/2023/05/30/dua-perusahaan-di-kawasan-industri-morowali-akan-dipasok-listrik-ramah-lingkungan\nhttps://teraskabar.id/warga-resah-bentangan-sutet-pltu-btiig-morowali-melintasi-permukiman-padat-penduduk/\nhttps://web.archive.org/web/20240731001954/https://indonesiabusinesspost.com/insider/local-community-complains-about-farm-road-grab-case-in-morowali/ (Archived Link)\nhttps://indonesiabusinesspost.com/insider/residents-sued-for-blocking-production-road-in-pt-ihip-industrial-zone/ \nhttps://www.mongabay.co.id/2024/07/05/masyarakat-terdampak-protes-proyek-kawasan-industri-ihip-di-morowali/?n3wsalert&utm_source=Indonesia&utm_campaign=63f85a0f92-mailchimp_id_all&utm_medium=email&utm_term=0_b093d7c92a-63f85a0f92-677458552&mc_cid=63f85a0f92&mc_eid=861564a5fe\nhttps://www.mongabay.co.id/2024/08/24/tewas-lagi-mengapa-kecelakaan-kerja-di-pabrik-nikel-terus-berulang/?n3wsalert&utm_source=Indonesia&utm_campaign=9a3fc70a41-mailchimp_id_all&utm_medium=email&utm_term=0_b093d7c92a-9a3fc70a41-677458552&mc_cid=9a3fc70a41&mc_eid=861564a5fe\nhttps://investor.id/energy/330941/pln-ip-kembangkan-5000-mw-captive-power-di-kawasan-industri-morowali\nhttps://topkota.co/buka-konsultasi-publik-amdal-pt-btiig-bupati-morowali-harap-jangan-sebatas-seremonial/" }, "geometry": { "type": "Point", "coordinates": [ 121.7711144, -2.287203087 ] } }
