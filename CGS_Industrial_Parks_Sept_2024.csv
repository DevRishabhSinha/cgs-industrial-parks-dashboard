""In 2000, PT Tritunas Bangun Perkasa established the first phase of the Tunas Batam Industrial Estate project, namely Tunas 1, to meet the need for industrial manufacturing buildings in Batam. There are 85 high quality building units that meet the standards of industrial manufacturing needs at Tunas 1 Industrial. Dozens of tenants from various national and multi-national companies chose Tunas 1 Industrial as the best place for their business operations and development.
As Batam's economy has grown very rapidly in recent years, this has led to an increase in demand for new industrial land in Batam. Therefore, in March 2012 PT Tritunas Bangun Perkasa continued the construction of the Tunas Batam Center Industrial Estate to the second phase of the project, namely Tunas 2 Industrial.
Also followed in May 2012, we built Tunas Bizpark as a business area connected to Tunas 1 and Tunas 2 Industrial. Now, Tunas Batam Center Industrial Estate has become a complete integrated commercial and industrial area with a total land area of 64 hectares.""",Operational,2000,,,24,0,0,0,0,0,0,,0,0,0,0,0,0,Mixed/General,"Mix - Electronics, Metal Stamping, Glass, Aluminum, Packaging, Consumer Goods, Plastic Moulding, Garment, Cigarettes, Marine Repair, Warehouse, Printing, Rubber, Manufacturing, Agriculture, Leather Seats, Cocoa, Calbe, Stainless Steel Wire ",https://kfmap.asia/industrial/union-industrial-park-13166https://bpbatam.go.id/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/E-BOOK-Batam-industrial-estate-2022.pdf,"https://bpbatam.go.id/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/E-BOOK-Batam-industrial-estate-2022.pdf

Improper disposal of waste from the Bekasi International Industrial Estate resulted in a lawsuit from the Bekasi Regency Government.

Environmental concerns:
Improper disposal liquid waste, environmental pollution
news.klikbekasi.co, 10/22/2015: It has been proven that the Bekasi Hyundai Industrial Area pollutes the environment
Bekasi International Industrial Estate (BIIE) or known as the Hyundai Industrial area has been proven to have polluted the surrounding environment. The disposal of factory liquid waste at Hyundai is not in accordance with regulations.
""Hyundai admits its guilt,"" said Head of the Civil and Administrative Section of the Cikarang District Attorney Rolando Ritonga recently.
Rolando said, Hyundai did not extend the liquid waste disposal permit (IPL C). Hyundai's industrial waste has also exceeded the quality standard threshold.
""Results of a study by the Ministry of Environment, the Cikadu river, which flows into the CBL river to the sea, is experiencing extraordinary pollution due to Hyundai's waste disposal,"" said Rolando.
The lawsuit was then settled for Rp. 2 billion
On June 6, 2014, the Bekasi Regency Government sued PT Hyundai Inti Development in a civil lawsuit with a compensation value of IDR 16 billion.
PT Hyundai Inti Development is the manager of the Hyundai industrial area and is responsible for permitting the disposal of liquid waste from local factories.
The value of IDR 16 billion is determined based on calculations from the Ministry of Environment experts. ""Compensation is calculated from 2010 to February 2014,"" said Rolando.
Initially, the government and Hyundai negotiated out of court. Hyundai stated that it was only able to pay compensation of 147 million. The government refused.
Hyundai then increased its offer to Rp 200 million, but the government still refused. Finally, Hyundai agreed to Rp 400 million. The government still refuses.
“Finally brought to court. The government and Hyundai agreed on a figure of Rp 2 billion. It must be paid no later than November 2015. The money goes to the regional administration,"" said Rolando.
In addition to paying Rp 2 billion, Hyundai is required to repair the sewage system so there will be no more pollution. Within 8 months, the canal repair should be completed.
""If it doesn't complete the repairs within the allotted time, Hyundai will have to pay Rp 5 billion. That's the deal,"" he said.
PT Hyundai Inti Development's lawyer, Army Mulyanto, explained that his client had paid Rp. 1 billion to the West Java Bank (BJB) account belonging to the Bekasi Regency Government.
""Hyundai has paid Rp. 1 billion in early October. The drawback, another Rp. 1 billion, is paid no later than 30 days after the first payment,"" said Army.
According to the Army, Hyundai is also working on repairing the sewage channel that will flow into the Cikadu River as agreed with the government.
“Hyundai will fulfill all the agreements. As for channel repairs, Hyundai is currently repairing them,"" said Army.

“Energy & Resource Efficiency and Carbon Footprint (GRI 302, GRI 302–1, GRI 302–3, GRI 302–4) The Company strives for efficient operational activities, including in terms of energy and resource utilization. The energy consumption comes from electricity supplied by PT Perusahaan Listrik Negara, PT Cikarang Listrindo and PT Bekasi Power (subsidiaries) which is used for operational and production activities, especially the production of clean water, wastewater treatment and supporting facilities in the form of public street lighting (PJU). In addition to electrical energy, the Company also operates transport vehicles and generators using fossil fuels for operational activities of estate management and security. Despite the emissions generated directly by these activities, we recognize the importance of reducing the carbon footprint in our operations and production...
In 2022, BP managed to install Rooftop Solar Power Plants for its customers with a total capacity of 1.03 Megawattpeak (MWp) and an additional 1.05 MWp has been installed in early 2023. 
On February 24, 2011, BP and PT Perusahaan Listrik Negara (PLN) agreed and entered into the Sale and Purchase Electricity Cooperation Agreement (“Agreement”). Based on this Agreement, BP will provide Net Power Capability to PLN which is sourced from all systems in Gas and Steam Power Plant (combined cycle) (PLTGU) owned by BP in net capacity totaling 118.8 MegaWatt (MW). This Agreement has an effective date from the date of funding and will be over in 20 (twenty) years from Commercial Operation Date, except terminated earlier according to the Agreement. Commercial Operation Date is the day after passing the operation test facility in accordance with testing procedures, which occurred on January 5, 2013. 
In early 2018, PLN through Pusat Pengaturan Beban (P2B) Jawa Bali, issued a reserve shutdown status to BP which means BP is required to distribute 0 (zero) kilowatt (KWh) to PLN so that BP is treated as a cold reserve by PLN. In the Electricity Power Selling and Purchasing Agreement between BP and PLN, BP will continue to receive payment from PLN with take or pay scheme of readiness and availability of BP’s power plant at the cost of PLTGU capacity. In a take or pay scheme, the components calculated as the basis for the billing of capacity payments are the components of the investment cost and fixed operating and maintenance cost that represent payment for the plant Net Power. As a condition, BP should always maintain the availability of its power plant in accordance with operational plan and dispatch request from P2B including maintaining gas availability from gas provider required for power plant operation. Up to now, BP always meets the terms and conditions needed to be able to issue invoice to PLN. This will significantly decrease BP’s revenue but the gross profit will remain intact hence BP can still cover the operational expenses. Since end of March 2018, BP has sold electricity again to PLN until now.

(Universitas Pertamina, 2/5/2023, univeritaspertamina.ac.id): Building PLTS in the Jababeka Industrial Area, Pertamina supports the First Net Zero Industrial Cluster in Southeast Asia
""In collaboration with Jababeka, Pertamina presents an energy mix through building and developing more environmentally friendly energy. This collaboration resulted in a Solar Power Plant (PLTS) with a capacity of 230 kWp which supports electricity needs in the first Net Zero Industrial Cluster in Southeast Asia. Jababeka is also one of 12 Net Zero Industrial Clusters throughout the world...This PLTS was inaugurated by the Director General of EBTKE of the Indonesian Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources Dadan Kusdiana, Main Director of Pertamina Nicke Widyawati, Chief Executive Officer of Pertamina New and Renewable Energy Dannif Danusaputro and Main Director of Jababeka Tjahjadi Rahardja Wednesday (11/1). Installed in the Jababeka Industrial Area, PLTS which is capable of producing 308 MWh of electricity per year has the potential to reduce Co2 by 258 tons of CO2 per year and is ready to operate to support the realization of the Jababeka Green Industrial Estate.""

(Jababeka & Co, 2019, jababeka.com/infrastructure/): 
""In order to augment power requirements from the industrial estate and surroundings, Jababeka embarked on a 130MW Power Plant, operated and managed by wholly owned subsidiary PT Bekasi Power. Jababeka has looked in the future and realized power demand will keep growing, which is why enough space for a second 130MW power plant is available.
The Power Plant consists of two state-of-the-art frame 6B gas turbines, manufactured by General Electric Energy with an installed capacity of 40 – 42 MW each by ISO rating. Furthermore, there are two heat recovery steam generators (HRSG) from Thermax Babcock and Wilcox Limited. The combined cycle is completed by a steam turbine from Shin Nippon with a capacity of 46 – 50 MW, which is driven by pressurized high temperature steam from both HRSGs that are fired by using the exhaust gasses from the gas turbines. The total installed capacity amounts to 130MW and is planning to double its capacity to 2 x 130MW in the coming years.
A Joint Operation Agreement between PLN and Bekasi Power allows Bekasi Power to not only enhance Kota Jababeka’s electricity and energy infrastructure by providing specialized services to industrial customers, but also directly support PLN’s mission to strengthen its electricity system, especially in the Bekasi and Karawang industrial areas.""

The company has a long and successful operating track record as one of the longest-running PPU in Indonesia and positioned itself as a partner of PLN and 5 (five) industrial estates together with various industries operating in these regions. 
The company has two gas-fired units with an aggregated capacity of 864 MW and 280 MW coal-fired generation located across the Cikarang and Babelan, Bekasi regions, respectively. The diversification in its operations allows us to provide an uninterrupted power supply. The coal-fired plant - commission in 2017 - adds to our operational diversification, given the different site location as well as fuel diversity.
Renewable Prokects
...As of December 2022, we have successfully installed a 12.5 MW Rooftop Solar Power on our customers' office rooftop. In addition to efforts to develop renewable energy and Greenhouse Gas (GHG) reduction through Rooftop Solar Power, since 2018, the company has been using biofuel to reduce coal in Circulating Fluidized Bed (CFB) boilers of the Babelan power station. Furthermore, in 2021, the Company has once again shown its commitment for GHG reduction through installation of biomass handling system in CFPP Babelan.
Industrial Service Area of the Company
As a holder of an integrated IUKU, the Company manages dedicated supply areas in 5 industrial estates, including the Jababeka Industrial Estate, MM-2100, East Jakarta Industrial Park, Hyundai Inti Development and Lippo Cikarang and its expansion.""

PLN also pledged to support a data center in the park with 933 MVA in 2021.

(W.media, 9/14/2021): Indonesia’s utility PLN collaborates with Greenland International Industrial Centre (GIIC) Kota Deltamas Industrial Area for country’s First National DC
""Indoensia’s State-owned electricity company PLN is collaborating with the Greenland International Industrial Centre (GIIC) Kota Deltamas industrial area for Indonesia’s first national data centre.
Located in Cikarang, West Java, the project is part of the government’s vision of becoming a hub for international data centres, according to a report in the JakartaPost.
The agreement between PLN and GIIC was signed on Tuesday by PLN regional business – Java, Madura, Bali director Haryanto WS, PLN enterprise and customer management Bob Saril, PT Puradelta Lestari and PT Pembangunan Deltamas president director Hongky Jeffry Nantung, as well as PT Pembangunan Deltamas director Naritsugu Tomita.
As a part of the deal, PLN is committed to supply Indonesia’s first data centre with international standards with the required 993 MVA of 24-hour electricity.
Indonesia set to be the fastest growing market for data centres in SEA, with a growth rate of 22 per cent per annum over the next five years, according to a report by Cushman & Wakefield.
During the agreement signing, PLN president director Zulkifli Zaini said that the project requires a green and reliable electricity supply in line with the global community. “In line with the Indonesian President’s mandate of transforming Indonesia into an international data centre hub, PLN is ready to fully support their plans to the best of our ability,” he said.
In his opening remarks, Communications and Informations Minister Johnny G. Plate said that electricity infrastructure readiness is vital to the readiness of data centre infrastructure, as data centers businesses are effectively power supply businesses which require a constant supply of electricity...
PT Puradelta Lestari and PT Pembangunan Deltamas president director Hongky Jeffry Nantung expressed his hopes that data centre companies in GIIC and Indonesia will be able to receive a reliable supply of electricity and renewable energy.
“Two, three years ago we were not yet able to answer those demands, but with this collaboration, renewable green energy certified with international standards will be a huge help,” he said.
According to Zulkifli, PLN’s collaboration with GIIC is evidence that the company is able to supply high-quality electricity with competitive prices, allowing its customers to focus more on managing their businesses. PLN customers will also have the option of renewable energy through their products and services, such as Renewable Energy Certificate, Premium Green, Carbon Credit, or other products as required by developers or investors.“

(PT Puradelta Lestari Tbk, 2021, deltamas.id): ""Further, GIIC is one of only a few industrial areas in the country that offers premium electricity infrastructure and supplies from the state owned company, PT Perusahaan Listrik Negara (Persero), which guarantees uninterrupted operation activities.  Electricity for GIIC’s industrial tenants is supplied from two extra-high voltage substations (GITET), namely GITET Cibatu and GITET Deltamas.""

(Bisnic.com, 8/13/2023, bandung.bisnis.com): Catalyst Factory Construction Progress at KIKC Entering the Completion Stage
""The progress of building a catalyst factory made by the nation's children located in the Kujang Cikampek Industrial Area (KIKC) is starting to enter the final stage. The construction of this factory was initiated by PT Katalis Sinergi Indonesia (KSI). PT KSI itself is a real manifestation of synergy between state-owned companies, educational institutions and scientists. This company is a consortium, namely between PT Pupuk Kujang which has joined with PT Research and Technology Center (RTC) and the Catalysis Engineering Center of the Bandung Institute of Technology (ITB). ""Currently, construction of the Catalyst factory is in the completion stage,"" said VP of Corporate Communications M Arief Rachman in his statement, Friday (18/8/2023). As is known, he said, the company will later focus on producing catalysts to make green fuel or environmentally friendly fuel. As for Pupuk Kujang Cikampek itself, as a petrochemical company, it also contributed to this.
Arief said that a catalyst is a substance that can speed up and direct chemical reactions when converting a raw material into another desired material.  ""A catalyst is very necessary to speed up the reaction in the process of converting palm oil or castor oil into biofuel (BBN),"" he said.
In the future, this biofuel is projected to be widely used. This is because fossil fuel oil will increasingly run out because it cannot be renewed. With catalysts, Indonesia can reduce the use of fossil fuels in everyday life. In the transportation sector, the use of fossil-based fuels is slowly being shifted and shifted to electrical energy and biofuels (BBN). To make BBN, a number of technologies are prepared including important materials such as catalysts.   ""So far, the use of catalysts in Indonesia still depends on imports. KSI products can later be used as import substitutes which will save the country's foreign exchange,"" said Arief. At ITB, one example of a product is a catalyst for converting palm oil into vegetable diesel (green diesel) or vegetable gasoline (green gasoline/bio gasoline) and which converts palm kernel oil into vegetable avtur (green avtur/bio avtur) all three of which are in the form of extrudates . The plan is that PT Katalis Sinergi Indonesia will produce a hydrotreating catalyst as an important ingredient in making biofuel which converts palm oil into diesel oil (D100). Apart from that, PT KSI can also make oleochemical catalysts for various industries. Meanwhile, some time ago the President Director of PT KSI Achmad Setiawan explained that this catalyst factory has a production capacity of 800 tons per year. This company is projected to be able to make 7 types of catalyst products. Namely 4 types of hydrotreating catalysts and 3 types of oleochemical catalysts.  This production is expected to be able to meet domestic catalyst needs. As a result, dependence on imported catalysts could be eroded. So, Indonesia does not need to import almost all of its catalyst needs. ""By establishing this factory, we are striving for independence so that we are not dependent on foreign nations. We are proving that Indonesia is capable of making its own catalyst,"" said Achmad some time ago. According to Achmad, the construction of this catalyst factory opens up opportunities for Indonesia to become independent in process technology and industrial resilience. The factory stands on 2 hectares of land at KIKC. (K60)""

(Jakarta Daily, 11/18/2021, jakartadaily.id): Karawang International Industry City and SUN Energy Sign Agreement On Renewable Energy Use
""Karawang International Industrial City (KIIC) and SUN Energy, a developer of solar panels, have signed a partnership to increase the use of renewable energy from solar panels in the industrial zone of Karawang, West Java.
Sanny Iskandar, president director of KIIC, who is also the chairman of the Association of Indonesian Industrial Zones (HKI) said that KIIC is committed to developing an environmentally friendly industrial zone by ensuring a balance between business development and environmental protection. The KIIC as the biggest industrial zone in Karawang supports the government in increasing the use of renewable energy sources.
The Indonesian government is committed to implementing the Paris Agreement 2015 to reduce the impact of climate change. The commitment was reflected by the participation of President Joko Widodo (Jokowi) in the 26th Conference Of Parties (COP) in Glasgow, Scotland, in November 2021.
According to him, KIIC has utilized the solar power plant (PLTS) as an alternative energy source to replace fossil fuel-based power generation. Renewable energy use will not only reduce the climate change impact but will also increase the business efficiency of users. The KIIC has more than 170 companies as tenants, who use solar power at a capacity of more than 100 MWp.
According to Dion Jefferson, the chief commercial officer of SUN Energy, two tenants of KIIC have become its business partners to implement the program of using solar power. “We highly appreciate the commitment of KIIC to develop a green project in the industrial zone. SUN Energy will help the KIIC and all its tenants to realize their contribution to the reduction of climate change impact through the development of PLTS under various schemes of financing.""

""PT PLN (Persero) Group through its subsidiary, PLN Batam has started a project to build the largest ground-mounted Solar Power Plant in Indonesia with a capacity of 100 Megawatt peak (MWp).
This PLTS project officially started with a groundbreaking ceremony which took place on Friday (27/10), in the Bukit Indah City Industrial Area, Purwakarta Regency, West Java.
This collaboration between PT PLN and PT Aruna Cahaya Pratama (Aruna PV) is concrete evidence of collaboration, between the private sector and State-Owned Enterprises (BUMN), in supporting efforts to reduce carbon emissions and increase industrial competitiveness.
According to the Director General of Electricity at the Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources (ESDM), Jisman P. Hutajulu, this project is one of the results of important synergy between the government, BUMN and the private sector to provide clean energy for the community...
This project, with a capacity of 100 MWp, will use around 170 thousand solar panel modules installed on the ground in five different locations in the Bukit Indah Industrial City area covering an area of ​​more than 85 hectares.
President Director of Aruna PV, Audwin Purwadi, explained that many multinational companies in the Bukit Indah City industrial area need a clean electricity supply, and this is what motivated the construction of this PLTS.
""This PLTS construction project can be carried out because PLN provides the opportunity to collaborate in utilizing new, renewable energy. ""PLN's collaboration with Aruna in this project is also supported by PT Tatajabar Sejahtera (TJS) as the offtaker, and PT Besland Pertiwi as the project land owner,"" said Audwin.
It is hoped that the construction of this PLTS will create a significant economic impact, by creating jobs, supporting local businesses, and encouraging economic growth in the surrounding area.

This is a commitment from the vision of the Cikembar industrial area to present an industrial area that is environmentally friendly, comfortable and open to the surrounding community.
The industrial area developed by PT Bogorindo Cemerlang stands on a 220 hectare land in the Cikembar area. In the first stage of development, the Cikembar industrial area is marketing commercial buildings and industrial plots that can be adapted to the needs of entrepreneurs...
According to Irma, the marketing gallery is also equipped with a cullinary area facility with Cappadocia nuances which is the right choice for hanging out with a cozy and Instagrammable atmosphere as well as being a strategic meeting point in Cikembar District.
""This event began with praying together, cutting the ribbon, and remarks from the Director of PT Bogorindo Cemerlang, Au Bintoro who is also the Founder of the Olympic Group. Then the event continued with the ceremonial release of 64 balloons consisting of 32 gold balloons and 32 green balloons. The gold color symbolizes the maturity of PT Bogorindo Cemerlang which has been active for 32 years to achieve success with shareholders and the people of Cimanggu Village, Cikembar District,"" he said.
PT Bogorindo Cemerlang believes that the opening of the Cappadocia marketing gallery and Culinary area will provide livelihoods for the people around the industrial area and bring fresh air to the investment climate in Sukabumi Regency. After carrying out the ceremonial activities, the participants were taken on a tour to monitor the maturation of the plots and infrastructure work.
""The Cikembar industrial area is currently focusing on infrastructure work such as road bodies, with a 14-meter ROW, waterways, PJU and utility boxes that comply with industrial area standards,"" he stated.
For this reason, infrastructure work continues to be matured so that companies in the area can carry out manufacturing developments. The event participants will also visit the site of the Dutch house which is now the operational office for the Cikembar industrial area and enjoy treats from agricultural products on the region's land. Then the participants returned to the Marketing Gallery for a culinary tour in the culinary area of ​​Cappadocia.
""With this marketing gallery, it is hoped that it will make it easier for potential investors to get information on minifactories and industrial plots with various attractive offers with operating hours Monday to Friday at 08.00 WIB to 17.00 WIB and Saturday at 08.00 WIB to 12.00 WIB,"" he concluded.

Issues regarding manager PT Bogorindo Cemerland's Hak Guna Bangunan (HGU - right to cultivate land administered by the state, only granted for agriculture, plantations, fisheries, poultry) and community access to the land. The resolution of the land allocation issue is unclear.  In 2016, Tatang Sofyan, the Head of the Land Agency of Sukabumi Regency and Rudolf Imam Santoso, among others, were designated suspects by the Cibadak State Prosecutor's Office in a corruption case over potential bribery in the transfer of state HGU land from PT Tenjojaya in Tenjoyaya Village to PT Bogorindo Cemergland.

Based on an article by Seputar Jagat MP (2021), it appears that the land, which was formerly owned by PT. Tenjojaya, should have been returned to the state and accessible to over 100 local village cultivators (who have worked on the land since the 1970s) when PT. Tenjojaya's HGU expired. Instead, the HGU was transferred to Rudolf Imam Santoso, the head of PT Bogorindo. In 2021, it was reported that the land that had been transfered to PT. Bogorindo included structures built by Tenjojaya residents, such as the village office and schools, and that the community requested compensation and information on the ownership status of the land. 

On June 26, 2022, it was reported by Mata Investigasi that Patty Nurchalis disclosed that PT. Bogorindo Cemerland was obtained through corruption, based on numerous court decisions inpreceding years, and that the 299 hectares had been confiscated by the West Java High Prosecutor's Office since 2016. Additionally, in a letter to an Ombudsman at the West Java High Prosecutor's Office, ""Nurchalis emphasized that the Prosecutor's Commission issued a recommendation for the PT.

Low groundwater levels in Bandung, likely due to industrial activities.
kompas.com, 6/2/2023: The groundwater level in Bandung has fallen by 60 percent, industry is suspected to be the cause
Throughout the Cileunyi area to Rancaekek , Bandung Regency, West Java, the groundwater level has decreased(cone of depression) and is in the vulnerable category. Rita Susilawati, Head of the Center for Groundwater and Environmental Geology (PATGTL) at the Geological Agency, said that the lowering of the groundwater level, which is in a delicate condition, is due to excessive water withdrawal.  Rita revealed, based on the Groundwater Conservation Map of the Bandung–Soreang Groundwater Basin (CAT) compiled by the Geological Agency in 2010, in the Cileunyi area and its surroundings there has been a decrease in the pressured groundwater level (deep groundwater or artesian) to around 60 meters below the ground surface. local.
So that the area, he continued, is a vulnerable area with a reduction rate of 40 percent to 60 percent from the initial condition. ""This phenomenon was seen in several places, including around the Cileunyi area to the Rancaekek area and its surroundings,"" he said via text message, Monday (6/2/2023). According to him, the Rancaekek area and its surroundings have a confined aquifer system (deep aquifer or artesian) at a depth of around 50 to 150 meters.
This area is hydrogeologically an area of ​​groundwater discharge from the Bandung–Soreang CAT. ""The pattern of depressed groundwater flow (deep groundwater) in the plains of Rancaekek and its surroundings indicates a conical phenomenon of lowering the groundwater level which indicates very intensive groundwater extraction,"" he said. In fact, he continued, the Rancaekek area has experienced a decrease in the depressed groundwater level (deep/artesian groundwater) to more than 70 meters below the local ground level. This causes the area to be an area prone to damage with a reduction rate of 40 percent to more than 80 percent from the initial condition. His party said that after 2010, the Geology Agency did not carry out monitoring of groundwater conditions in the Cileunyi and Rancaekek areas which were included in the Bandung-Soreang CAT. That authority, continued Rita, belongs to the government of West Java Province. ""Currently the authority to manage groundwater has changed to being based on river areas, and the Bandung area, which is included in the Citarum River area, becomes central authority, so that in 2023 the Geological Agency will again carry out groundwater monitoring activities in Bandung and its surroundings,"" he added. Water Conditions Rita added, the cause of the damaged groundwater conditions along Cileunyi to Rancaekek was due to excessive groundwater extraction in the area. Considering that there are many industrial buildings in the Rancaekek area , this does not rule out being the cause. However, continued Rita, it is necessary to further evaluate whether the industry is the cause of the decrease in the groundwater level in Cileunyi to Rancaekek. ""To find out whether the industry is the main cause, further evaluation is needed, because if the industry complies with the groundwater withdrawal regulations set forth in the permit, it should not cause problems,"" he said. His party highlighted the rampant illegal and unlicensed groundwater extraction. ""What must be paid attention to is illegal or unlicensed groundwater extraction which is still rife. Unlicensed drilled wells cannot control the discharge of groundwater pumping, so it has the potential to cause damage to groundwater conditions in an area,"" he concluded.",0,0,0,0,0,0,Mixed/General,"Textile, Food Industry, Warehouse, Cables, Garments, Pharmaceutical, Printing, Laboratorium Equipment, Contractor, Shoe Manufacturer, Laminating, Face Mask Manufacturer","PT.

This was conveyed by the Director General of International Industrial Access Resilience and Development (KPAII), Ministry of Industry of the Republic of Indonesia, Doddy Widodo during a visit to KIT Ketanggan Village, Gringsing District, Batang Regency, Friday (24/7/2020). With the construction of KIT Batang, he said, it will become a magnet to attract investors, both from within and outside the country.
""Around 108 to 2,027 hectares will be built by 2024. Not only as an attraction, but as a supply in the northern corridor between Serang, Banten, and Banyuwangi, East Java,"" explained Doddy.
He added that the Ministry of Industry supports the KIT Batang concept which will be integrated with worker housing, education, health services and an inter-factory supply chain. Apart from that, the existence of KIT Batang is a solution to investors' complaints regarding land prices and supporting facilities.
""The main complaint from investors is that land prices have fluctuated greatly after it was designated as an industrial area. ""But at KIT Batang, the land prices and facilities are more competitive and able to compete with industrial areas (in) China,"" he said.

""The Bantul Regency Government has reprimanded the manager of the Piyungan Industrial Area (KIP), PT Yogyakarta Isti Pratama (YIP) following the lack of significant progress in developing the area. The warning was issued some time ago as an effort by the Bantul Regency Government to accelerate the development of KIP.
“I give a warning to PT YIP. Why is there no progress? ""He said he was able to bring in investors,"" said Bantul Regent Abdul Halim Muslih, Thursday (3/6/2021).
Halim revealed that the aim of the warning given by the Bantul Regency Government to PT YIP was to accelerate development and development to attract more investors to KIP.
Because, during the six years of managing KIP, PT YIP, which has authority over 85 hectares of land in the area, has only used 6.5 hectares.
Therefore, the District Government is worried that the remaining 14 year lease owned by PT YIP will not be optimal and will have an impact on economic growth in Bantul.
""""I am worried that this will affect the interest of potential investors, because the lease period is only 14 years.
The district government itself is committed to budgeting for and building road access to the industrial location,"" he explained.
Halim further revealed that the Regency Government had budgeted IDR 39 billion for land acquisition and construction of infrastructure for entry and exit access to KIP. Apart from that, the District Government has an interest in KIP as an effort to absorb labor, economic growth, community partnerships and poverty alleviation.
""So the faster it develops, the faster KIP will have a positive impact on other sectors,"" said Halim.
Separately, the Head of the Bantul Cooperatives, UMKM and Industry Service, Agus Sulistyana, said that PT YIP had made industrial zones at KIP. However, until now not all of the land has been used. Meanwhile, the district government is also preparing another industrial area, namely in Sedayu. In fact, currently there are several investors who are interested in entering.
""The direction for Sedayu is that it can be managed by the district government itself,"" he said.""

Java Integrated Industrial and Ports Estate ( JIIPE ) has brought in investment worth IDR 52 trillion since it was designated as a Special Economic Zone (KEK) in Gresik, East Java. The Gresik SEZ, which is a national strategic project (PSN), in which there are two entities, namely PT BKMS as the developer and manager of the industrial area (development and management business entity) is a joint venture between PT Pelindo (Persero) and PT AKR Corporindo Tbk. with an ownership composition of 40% and 60%. Another entity is PT BMS as the manager of the port area (port business entity) with a composition of 60% and 40%.  Before October 1 2021, when four port management companies merged to become PT Pelindo (Persero), the two companies were affiliates of PT Pelindo III, while residential areas were developed and managed directly by PT AKR Surabaya Land Corporindo.
PT BKMS Director of HR and Logistics Agung P. Guritno said that the government is targeting foreign investment in JIIPE to reach US$16 billion or around Rp. 250 trillion. ""So far, since it was designated as a KEK, investment entering JIIPE has reached around IDR 52 trillion and will continue to increase along with regional development,"" he explained in a press release, Friday (10/11/2023).
Agung is optimistic that the targets set by the government will be met because of the various facilities provided by the government and industrial areas, especially connectivity between areas around Gresik and with the port. Achieving the target begins with the inclusion of mining product processing facilities or known as smelters owned by PT Freeport Indonesia, which is one of the leading industries in JIIPE. As part of the government's industrial downstream program, Freeport became JIIPE's anchor tenant with an area of ​​100 hectares.  As of the end of August 2023, the directors of PT Freeport Indonesia told the media that construction of the factory had reached 76%. Freeport is rushing to fulfill President Joko Widodo's request that this factory be operational by May 2024. The Freeport smelter factory, which was built with an investment of US$ 3 billion, is one of 21 companies that have joined JIIPE. Since JIIPE was confirmed as a special economic zone, five large tenants have joined and it is hoped that this will stimulate further interest from foreign investors to invest in the Gresik KEK. Built in 2012, the JIIPE Industrial Area was officially designated as a KEK through Government Regulation (PP) No. 71 of 2021 dated 28 June 2021 concerning the Gresik Special Economic Zone, with business activities consisting of production and processing; logistics and distribution; research, digital economy, technology development; and energy development supported by industry 4.0. This area, with a total area of ​​3,000 hectares, consists of the development of an industrial area of ​​1,761 hectares and a port area of ​​406 hectares, where both areas are SEZs supported by a residential area of ​​800 hectares. With various clusters, namely metal, electronic, chemical, energy, support and export-oriented logistics , the area integrated with the deep sea port has multipurpose dock facilities covering an area of ​​500X50 meters, with a pier length of 1,000 m and supported by a sea depth of up to -14 LWS, JIIPE port has the capacity to accommodate ships up to 100,000 DWT. The JIIPE area is not only integrated with the port, but also has toll access, namely the Surabaya-Manyar Toll Road and the Krian-Legundi-Bunder-Manyar (KLBM) Toll Road which are currently in the completion stage of the Bunder-Manyar section, which will later be integrated with the KLBM Toll Road section. Trans Java and has direct access from the area. ""The distance from JIIPE to the Surabaya-Manyar toll gate is only three kilometers which is connected to the provincial road known as Jalan Daendels,"" said PT BKMS HR and Logistics Director Agung P. Guritno, at the end of last October. The district and provincial governments have completed part of the widening of the provincial road which is one of the access points to JIIPE. ""Only access to the Bunder-Manyar Toll Road is still in the completion stage,"" added Agung. Later, this 9.39 kilometer long project will have direct toll gate access from JIIPE. Not only road access and various infrastructure such as water, gas and electricity networks that have been and are being built at JIIPE. The government also provides various one-stop tax and licensing facilities through KEK administrators.""

(Antara News, 4/23/2023, en.antaranews.com): Minister urges Freeport to expedite smelter construction
""Minister of Energy and Mineral Resources (ESDM) Arifin Tasrif has asked mining company PT Freeport Indonesia to accelerate the construction of a copper processing and refining plant (smelter) in Gresik, East Java.
""They have to speed up the completion of the smelter as soon as possible. Until now, the progress has reached 60 percent with a quite large budget amounting to US$1.5 billion. If it is not finished, it will be such a waste,"" he said at the Presidential Palace Complex in Jakarta on Friday.
Currently, PT Freeport Indonesia is building a new copper smelter in Manyar, Special Economic Zone (KEK), Java Integrated Industrial and Port Estate (JIIPE), Gresik, East Java, which is targeted to become fully operational in 2024.
The Indonesian government has verified the construction progress of the Manyar smelter to be more than 50 percent complete, Tasrif informed.
However, referring to Law Number 3 of 2020 concerning Mineral and Coal Mining (Minerba), three years after the regulation was issued on June 10, 2020, that is, from June 10, 2023, all raw minerals meant for export will need to go through a process of increasing added value in the country. Therefore, the government will also need to stop exports of raw minerals, including copper.
""We have decided to allow the export of copper concentrate. PT Freeport Indonesia must also finish the smelter and not later than the middle of next year,"" he said.
Apart from PT Freeport Indonesia, Tasrif said that PT Amman Mineral Nusa Tenggara (AMNT) has also been allowed to export copper concentrate.
It is known that PT Freeport Indonesia and AMNT are also building a new copper concentrate processing plant in Batu Hijau, West Sumbawa district, West Nusa Tenggara (NTT), at an estimated investment value of US$982 million, or equivalent to Rp14.7 trillion. However, the construction schedule has been delayed due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
""If the construction is hampered, it will affect thousands of workers there. We hope the company to have a commitment to finish the project. For now, we are aiming to achieve industrial downstreaming by taking advantage of natural resources as much as possible,"" Tasrif said.
The Manyar smelter project is projected to process 1.7 million tons of copper concentrate per year into around 600 thousand tons of cathode copper per year.""

(Jakarta Globe, 1/27/2023, jakartaglobe.id): Freeport's Manyar Smelter to Pave Way for Indonesia’s EV Ecosystem
""Mining giant Freeport Indonesia recently said that its smelter for copper -- a critical component for electric vehicle or EV production -- at the Java Integrated Industrial and Port Estate in Gresik would finish construction by the end of this year.
Once completed, the Manyar Smelter could give a major boost to Indonesia's dream of building an EV ecosystem. The construction is halfway done, specifically 51.7 percent complete as of the end of December 2022. 
""So the downstream and upstream sectors would become one. Refining copper domestically would boost the added values for the copper concentrate from the current 95 percent to 100 percent,” Freeport Indonesia president director Tony Wenas told BTV in a recent interview.
“And also contribute to the EV ecosystem that is currently being built in Indonesia. Copper will play a pivotal role in the EV ecosystem,” Tony said.
The $3 billion Manyar Smelter is expected to process 1.7 million tons of copper concentrates a year. Freeport’s existing smelter PT Smelting has an annual capacity of a million tons of copper concentrates. Combined, Freeport Indonesia’s copper concentrate processing capacity can reach 3 million tons a year. Freeport Indonesia claimed the Manyar plant would become the world’s largest single-line smelter. 
The Manyar Smelter is slated to begin commercial operations in end-2024, marking the end of copper concentrate ore exports from Freeport Indonesia.""

Meanwhile, KITW has a special status because it holds the status of a National Strategic Project (PSN) in accordance with Presidential Regulation (Perpres) 58 of 2017, so that processing regional permits can be made easier.  Wilmar Project and Technical Director Erik Tjia said that investment growth had indeed slowed down due to the pandemic, but it was predicted that it would soon increase after the economy recovered. He is optimistic that the growing economy will have a positive impact on industrial area businesses.  ""We hope that the value of incoming investment will continue to increase,"" said Erik Tjia in a press conference at KITW, Serang, Banten, Friday (28/10/2022).  
KITW Serang has made a positive contribution to the region through paying regional taxes, absorbing 70 percent-80 percent of the workforce from local communities, and other multiplier-effects . Erik explained that of the total land reserved for the development of KITW covering an area of ​​800 ha, 200 ha had been utilized for Wilmar's interests, in the form of building factories for cooking oil, rice, margarine, biodiesel, flour, jetties, packaging and employee housing. 
Apart from Wilmar, several investors have entered the area, such as Perusahaan Gas Negara (PGN) and PT Baja Putra Deli.  Erik hopes that with KITW's status as a PSN, it will be easier to obtain permits and support from the central and regional governments to accelerate investment growth.  ""Investment is one of the pillars of economic growth,"" said Erik.  According to the Business Unit Head of PT Multimas Nabati Asahan Serang, Wilmar Tenang Sembiring group, as an industrial area, KITW is equipped with various facilities, such as asphalt roads that have access to toll roads, gas supplies of up to 20 million standard cubic feet per day (million standard cubic feet per day / MMSCFD), electricity supply up to 500 mega watts (MW), water, fiber optics, hydrant systems, waste processing ( incineration plant ), waste water treatment ( water treatment ), public facilities, and railways.  ""We plan to continue developing this area,"" he said Even though it has very adequate facilities, Wilmar still has difficulties regarding vehicle access, especially trucks, from the toll road to the KITW area because there is no direct access. Currently, transport trucks have to pass through small roads and even residential areas to reach KITW.  Tenang further said that another double effect was the absorption of workers, which currently at KITW has reached around 2,000 people, including construction workers.  Erik and Tenang hope that Wilmar's presence at KITW can supply food needs for Indonesia, especially Jabodetabek.""",Operational with Continued Construction,2018,,2016,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,,0,0,0,0,0,1,Mixed/General,"Oil and gas, chemicals, steel, gypsum, edible oil, and cement.","Wilmar, PT.

Rudi Wijaya, President Director of PT Millennium Power, said that PT PGN's willingness to supply gas for the PLTGU which will be built in the Millennium Industrial Estate area is a big capital for the company to accelerate the realization of the construction of this power plant . “This is a big event for us by getting gas support from PT PGN. ""Previously, PT PGN had supplied gas to tenants in the Millennium industrial area,"" he said in Jakarta, when signing the HoA, Wednesday (1/4/2015). Jobi Triananda Hasjim, Director of Business at PT PGN Tbk., said that the construction of a 1,000 MW PLTGU is a big project that is really needed by industry, especially in delivering electricity in the West Java region.
In the future, he continued, not only PT Millennium Power will be supported in supplying gas for PLTGU, but other parties such as PT Perusahaan Perusahaan Perusahaan Negara (PLN) which is actively replacing fuel oil-based power plants will also be fully supported by PGN. He said, with the volume of gas requested by PT Millennium Power up to 2024 being quite large, it is hoped that this collaboration can soon be upgraded to an agreement so that PGN can immediately search for and increase its gas supply. According to him, even though Indonesia's macroeconomy is currently unstable, in line with increasingly rapid industrial growth, electricity supply capacity to this sector must continue to be increased. Lebinner Sinaga, Tangerang Area Manager of PT PGN Tbk., said that the construction of the PLTGU will be carried out in four stages until 2024. The first stage of construction is targeted for completion in the first quarter of 2017 with a total volume of gas used of 40 million cubic meters.
""The total gas that will be supplied by PGN until the final stage of development reaches 240 million cubic meters,"" he said to Bisnis. When asked further regarding the form of cooperation and the volume of gas that would be supplied by PGN at each stage of the PLTGU construction, Lebinner said he did not currently have the cooperation documents.""

(Banten Raya, 10/22/2023, bantenraya.co): PT PSM and PSI Suspected of Air Pollution
""Acts of air pollution still occur frequently in the Tangerang area, this time allegedly carried out by two iron smelting factories PT Power Steel Mandiri (PSM) and PT Power Steel Indonesia (PSI) located in the Millennium Industrial Area, Tangerang Regency.
The impact of pollution was felt directly by the people of Cibarengkok Village, Peusar Village, Panongan District, Tangerang Regency, Banten. They complained about the presence of toxic and hazardous waste (B3) pollution which allegedly came from the iron smelting factory owned by PT Power Steel Indonesia in the Millennium Industrial Area.
""In the morning or evening, the smoke from this iron smelting factory reaches my house. ""Sometimes the pollution is so frequent and widespread that we are affected to the point of coughing,"" said Hermansyah, a resident of Peusar Village to journalists, last weekend.
According to him, the impact of B3 waste pollution from the iron smelting factory is very environmentally unfriendly, so it can cause the air conditions in residential areas to become unhealthy.
Apart from that, the pollution produced by factory activities is also detrimental to the health of residents and the surrounding environment because it is suspected to contain toxic and dangerous materials (B3).
""What makes us even more confused is that local government people know that this smelting factory is wrong, but they don't take any action,"" he said.
Another resident, Sutiyah (48), said that this air pollution condition had been occurring for several years. In fact, about three years ago residents demanded a meeting or mediation regarding the case of pollution at the iron smelting factory.
""We had a meeting before. And the company compensates residents for damages, only that only once. ""Now it's no longer there, the factory hasn't even improved its waste management,"" he said.
Meanwhile, in a separate place, the Head of the Legal Development Section of the Tangerang Regency Environmental Cleanliness Service (DLHK), Sandi Nugraha, stated that from the results of checks and tests in the field, the company or steel smelting factory was found to have 10 smelting furnaces (furnaces) equipped with hoods which function to capture emissions. dust and smoke poured into the teapot (reservoir).
However, dust or smoke emissions fly in the production area because the hood's ability to suck up dust does not operate normally. Thus, air pollution occurs which has a direct impact on the surrounding community.
""The situation becomes worse when strong winds blow (usually from midday to afternoon) which causes dust or smoke to reach the environment around the factory,"" he said.
He said, apart from finding negligence, the testing team from DLHK also found five emission chimney units that did not comply with the technical provisions of Kepdal No. 205 of 1996, namely sampling holes, chimney codes, coordinate points, and supporting facilities (ladders, safety fences, and platform).
""But at the time of our visit to the location the company was carrying out repairs on several chimneys,"" he said.
Nevertheless, he continued, with the discovery of several violations or negligence by the company, his party will continue to carry out supervision with a focus on monitoring improvements and improving air management resulting from production activities at the steel smelting factory.
Apart from that, his party also requires companies to periodically report environmental documents in accordance with existing/actual conditions every 6 (six) months to the Tangerang Regency DLHK or through the KLHK Environmental Electronic Reporting System (SIMPEL) portal.
""Companies are required to improve the performance of the hood, which functions to capture dust and smoke emissions that are poured into the jug (container) to minimize dust emissions or smoke flying in the production area and the environment around the factory,"" he said.""",0,0,0,0,0,0,Mixed/General,"packaging, automotive parts, food, chemicals, printing, paraffin wax, petrochemicals, plastics, more","Partial List: PT Cahaya Aritama Mandiri, PT Bukit Intan Gemilang Lestari, PT Gloria Karya Sukses, PT Wanli Boiler Material, PT Kreasi Senifika Mandiri, PT Indo Mandiri Sejahtera, PT Kirana Mitra Abadi, PT Petro Asia, PT Citra Aroma Nusantara, PT Huanyu Plastindo Indonesia, PT Alamanda Global Health, PT Indo RX, PT Fortech Lingkungan, PT Derma Elok Farma, PT Shinhoo Sojae Indonesia, PT Yifang Cargo Mutiara, PT Indo Kimia Abadi, PT Sino Packer Global, CV Takino, PT Mentari Metal Pratama, PT Protekindo Sanita, PT Indotara Persada, PT Karya Inti Mitra Abadi, PT Pangan Indo Mandiri, PT Gracia Trikreasi Pangan, PT Mega Pratama Medicalindo, PT Millwater Pratama Mandiri, PT Cakrawala Indopac, PT Gunung Rejeki Sejahtera, PT Power Steel Indonesia, CV Prima Lestari, PT Indo Asia Tirta Manuggal, PT Green Source Indonesia, Bpk Iman Salim

Environmental Impact:
In 2023, claims that Pasar Kemis was the most polluted area in South East Asia went viral on social media based on monitoring by the IQAir website. The head of the Tangerand Regency Environment and Hygiene Service clarified that these measurements were from 2022, and not accurate for 2023. The head of Pasar Kemis District admitted that air pollution was a big problem for the area, given its dense population and industrial areas, and said it would take coordination between government ad business actors to minimize air pollution (news.republika.co.id, 4/13/2023).

(Republik, 4/13/2023, news.republika.co.id): The Most Polluting Kemis Market in Southeast Asia, DLHK Tangerang: Data is Invalid
""Head of the Tangerang Regency Environment and Hygiene Service (DLHK), Achmad Taufik, claims that the status of air pollution in the Pasar Kemis area is not as bad as the information that has gone viral on social media (medsos). Based on monitoring of the IQAir website and application on Monday (10/04/2023) at 10:00 WIB, the air pollution status in the Pasar Kemis area was at moderate conditions (PM 2.5, namely 32.2 ug/m3 micro gram). 
""This is different from the data uploaded on social media which named Pasar Kemis District, Tangerang Regency as the most polluted area in Southeast Asia,"" said Taufik in his statement received by Republika , Wednesday (12/4/2023).
According to Taufik, the data that is widely uploaded on social media is old data, namely data for the period 2022. So, he continued, the data submitted by the reporter from social media Instagram is data from 2022 which is no longer valid.
He also clarified the data uploaded by seastats and seasia.co on his Instagram social media account, that Pasar Kemis District is the most polluted area in Southeast Asia in 2022 with a PM 2.5 particles value of 49.6.
Taufik said that the ranking status of IQAir results at the Pasar Kemis location in Tangerang Regency was not on the top most polluted ranking list. He claimed that the Tangerang Regency Government through DLHK could create a comfortable and beautiful living environment.
""Thank God, this is something we need to be grateful for, as part of our joint efforts, it can be seen from the data that we have checked the system IQ results which are still below air quality standards,"" said Taufik.
In line with the statement of the Head of DLHK, Head of Pasar Kemis District, Sony Karsan, said that collaboration between various parties is needed to minimize air pollution in Pasar Kemis District.
Considering that the Pasar Kemis area is a densely populated area and also an industrial area in Tangerang Regency. Nevertheless, his party admits that the air pollution problem in the Pasar Kemis District area will take a long time to overcome. 
""Given that from a geographical perspective this area is an industrial area and is densely populated, this is what causes pollution in the Pasar Kemis District area to be poor. Therefore cooperation and collaboration is needed from various parties,"" he said.
He also said that the Government continues to encourage efforts related to environmental problems in Pasar Kemis District, one of which is by providing education and giving advice to business actors and community members to plant trees in their respective environments.
""Currently we are also coordinating and communicating with the Tangerang Regency DLHK to provide education to business actors so that they can plant trees in their respective environments,"" he said.
Meanwhile, for motor vehicle pollution, the government's efforts are being encouraged to carry out emissions tests on motor vehicles in certain areas, especially in the Pasar Kemis area.""",0,0,0,0,0,0,Unknown,Unknown,,"https://manufakturindo.com/company/detail/pt-putera-daya-perkasa.html

(Detak Banten, 5/24/2022, detakbanten.com): Residents complain about the industrial area development project in Cileles Tigaraksa
""The PT Irama Gemilang Lestari (IGL) industrial area development project, which is located in Cileles Village, Tigaraksa District, Tangerang Banten Regency, has been complained about by farmers because, since March 2022, the rice fields belonging to several local residents can no longer be cultivated due to overflowing river water. Muhara, Sunday (22/5/2022).
Sopian, the owner of the rice field, who is also a local resident, said that the water overflowed and inundated his parents' rice field as a result of the PT Irama Gemilang Lestari (IGL) industrial area construction project, resulting in landslides and narrowing of the Muhara river.
Other rice field owners, Arumi and Budin, also felt the same thing. They admitted that they had been so badly affected that they were no longer able to grow crops due to flooding or overflowing waters of the Muhara River.
""The Muhara River, which used to be approximately 8 meters wide, has now shrunk to approximately 2 meters and due to heavy rain, the land around the industrial area collapsed and covered the river basin (DAS) so that the river water rose and flooded my parents' rice fields,"" complained Sopian. .
Sopian said that at the beginning of the construction of the industrial area, he had said that the river should be tidied up first, so that the residents' rice fields would not be flooded, but the developer ignored this.
""We hope that the government will be sensitive, because currently residents still need agricultural land as a source of income for residents,"" he explained.
Meanwhile, Dudung, a youth leader from Cileles Village, claimed that the local government was not sensitive to the effects or impacts of the IGL industrial area project. Dudung asked the government to look at the affected locations and find a solution.""

(PT Krakatau Chandra Energi, 2024, kce.co.id/product/energy): Power Plant
""The power generation capacity of PT Krakatau Daya Listrik (PT KDL) reaches 120 MW with Combined Cycle Power Plant (CCPP) technology. This CCPP has two units of Gas Turbine Generator (GTG), two units of Heat Recovery Steam Generator (HRSG) and one unit of Steam Turbine Generator (STG)...
Power Network Distribution System
PT KDL's transmission and distribution network is in the form of an underground electricity network. In terms of reliability, compared with overhead network, underground electricity network will be easier and safer to operate than overhead network. About 95 percent of PT KDL's distribution network uses ring system cable channels.
The distribution mechanism of PT KDL's electricity starts from the generation of electrical energy in each generator of 10.5 kilovolts (kV). In order to be properly channeled, the voltage is then increased to 150 kV to the divider rail (busbar). From each of these busbar voltages that have been adjusted are channeled to each customer of PT KDL ranging from 30 kV, 20 kV, 6 kV to 400 Volts.
PT KDL guarantees the quality of electrical energy produced according to industry standards. For this reason, PT KDL built a compensator system to maintain voltage stability. PT Krakatau Steel (Persero) Tbk. as the main consumer, gets the installation of compensator systems in each of its factory.
Interconnection with PLN
Initially PT KDL plant designed to operate independently (isolated system). But over time, the growth of many new factories in the Krakatau Industrial Estate also create new demand to PT KDL. To anticipate this, PT KDL’s CCPP interconnected with PLN. PT KDL's transmission network is interconnected with PLN's 150 kV network through High Voltage Air Conducting (HUTT).
Recently, the electricity supply contract from PLN is 200 MVA. Since August 2003, this supply contract expanded with an agreement to synergize electricity delivery between PLN, PT KS, and PT KDL. This is to compensate the condition of the electricity crisis during the Peak Load Time (WBP). During an emergency, this interconnection network will work hand in hand in the power plant start-up process.""

bantennews.co.id, 3/15/2023: Land Acquisition by PT Pancapuri Indoperkasa, Residents Trapped by Brokers
The Cilegon DPRD's facilitation of the polemic regarding land acquisition for residents in a number of neighborhoods in Gunung Sugih Village, Ciwandan District with PT Pancapuri Indoperkasa has entered a new phase. In a public hearing on Wednesday (15/3/2023), residents revealed that there was a practice of brokering in the land acquisition process so that they suffered losses.
Sayuti, one of the residents, said that as a result of this practice, he only received IDR 100 million in December 2020, for the down payment for the acquisition of his approximately 5,000 square meter land from PT Pancapuri Indoperkasa through Rusli, a broker. This value is far from the initially agreed price, namely IDR 1.49 billion.
""Even though I have never given any power of attorney to Rusli. ""That's why I keep asking what happens to the remaining payments,"" he said.
It was explained that after investigating it, it was later discovered that the management of PT Pancapuri Indoperkasa had paid off its obligations through Rusli's savings account, but unfortunately the amount was not as expected, namely only IDR 1.1 billion, which was suddenly rejected by Sayuti.
“Yes, of course we don't want to. Moreover, there is already an agreement that if the completion process is later than 2020, the price will be adjusted, even though we are not discussing this issue. ""We only demand rights,"" he said.
Rusli was also present at the hearing. In his statement, he said that the emergence of the problem was triggered by pressure on repayment by Sayuti and the payment pattern which was paid in installments and bailed out by individual employees of PT Pancapuri Indoperkasa with certain considerations so that the value did not match what Sayuti expected.
“After continuing to pay in installments for two years, finally I was confused. Because the family didn't want to accept it, they didn't want to return it to Pancapuri, so in the end the money was returned to me. ""Later, if the price is right, then I will give it to my family, this was my mistake at that time,"" said Rusli.
From this brokering practice, Rusli explained that he received a wage of IDR 5 thousand per meter from PT Pancapuri Indoperkasa. Furthermore, he even admitted the truth regarding him not holding a power of attorney from Sayuti. This was because his role as a broker for around 50 other land owners had long been known to many residents, long before he had any dealings with Sayuti.
“Essentially, I admit that I was wrong, and I fully understand the implications of the actions I have committed. In fact, from the start I told the family, if you want to report it to the police, you can. ""If it were me, I wouldn't be running anywhere, in fact it would be clear to see who is playing at Pancapuri,"" he explained.
Meanwhile, the Chairman of Commission I of the Cilegon DPRD, Masduki, hopes that this issue will reveal the dark veil of the polemic about land acquisition for residents by PT Pancapuri Indoperkasa which has not yet been resolved.
""What's even more strange is why Pancapuri can go to him (transact with Rusli), even though he doesn't have a power of attorney. But this is one of the cases, it could be that the previous problem also had a model like this. Well, everything will be revealed as to who the land mafia is, including the 50 residents (facilitated by brokers) who actually need to be investigated, but that's not in our area. It's possible that the polemic that arose at Mount Sugih was because of casuistry like this. ""From Pancapuri, it was completed but not delivered,"" said Masduki.
Unfortunately, the hearing which was attended by the Regional Financial and Asset Management Agency (BPKAD), the Head of the Legal Section of the Regional Secretariat of Cilegon City, the National Land Agency (BPN) of Cilegon City, Subdistricts and Districts was not also attended by the management of PT Pancapuri Indoperkasa.
""Even if Pancapuri cannot attend today without news and confirmation, we will invite him back later, and I will coordinate with the leadership,"" explained this PAN politician.

(BantenNews, 9/22/2022, bantennews.co.id): PT Pancapuri Indoperkasa Regrets Blocking Project Access by Cilodan Residents
""Dozens of residents of the Cilodan Neighborhood RT 18/05 Gunung Sugih Village, Ciwandan District, Cilegon City on Thursday (22/9/2022) blocked an environmental road which has been the access for PT Pancapuri Indoperkasa's heavy vehicle mobility for the development project of PT Chandra Asri Petrochemical ( CAP) 2.
The residents had to carry out the action of blocking the road and unfurling a banner containing the demands because it was confirmed that PT Pancapuri Indoperkasa had not completed its obligation to acquire the land belonging to the residents.
""The road has been used by Pancapuri for the road project, while my extended family, around 20 of the houses above, have not been released, that doesn't include the families below. We are disturbed by the dust from the project,"" said Dani Adhani (63), a resident to BantenNews.co.id.
According to Dani, his decision was unanimous regarding the acquisition value of approximately 3,000 square meters of land belonging to his family. However, the value offered has not yet received a response from PT Pancapuri Indoperkasa.
“Those who come to us are all brokers, not A1, whose Pancapuri people are. If you are a broker, you know yourself. Meanwhile, if my family has clearly asked for the figure of Rp. 5 million per meter, and that's okay, it doesn't count as house buildings. That's why we are blocking it, so it's better to just close it first,"" he explained.
According to Dani Adhani, the majority of local residents have left their homes after receiving payment for their release from PT Pancapuri Indoperkasa. ""All that's left here is my family, along with Haji Ismat's family, Sayani, the others have all been released,"" he said.

State-run PT Pertamina through its sub-holding Pertamina NRE and state-run plantation PT Perkebunan Nusantara III are producing green energy from palm oil liquid waste at Sei Mangkei biogas power plant (PLTBg), North Sumatra.  
The processing of palm oil liquid waste for electricity generation has the potential to reduce methane gas emissions, the companies said.
""This strategic cooperation is to increase new renewable energy in the energy mix while reducing carbon emissions,"" Pertamina NRE chief executive officer Dannif Danusaputro said in a statement released here on Saturday.
According to Danusaputro, the Sei Mangkei Special Economic Zone, located in Simalungun district, North Sumatra, is a green economic zone.
Biogas and solar-based energy sources are the foundation for ensuring electricity reliability in the region, he said.
Built on two hectares of land owned by Perkebunan Nusantara III, Sei Mangkei PLTBg has the capacity to produce 2.4 megawatts (MW) of power, he informed. The power plant absorbs 288,350 cubic meters of palm oil liquid waste per year, he added.
Meanwhile, president director of State Plantation Company III, Mohammad Abdul Ghani, revealed that the management of palm oil liquid waste overtly produces methane gas that is detrimental to the environment because it can accelerate global warming.
According to him, the presence of Sei Mangkei PLTBg, which utilizes palm oil liquid waste, has the potential to reduce methane gas emissions by about 2,500 methane hydrocarbons, or the equivalent of 70 thousand tons of carbon dioxide per year.
""As a form of commitment from State Plantation Company Group in the development of new renewable energy and supporting the achievement of the 23-percent energy mix target by 2025, we realized it through the advancement of PLTBg and co-firing biogas program in the company group's oil palm plantation unit with Pertamina NRE,"" Ghani said.
Sei Mangkei PLTBg has provided many benefits for the company, including reducing methane and carbon gas emissions, reducing fossil-based electricity consumption, and becoming a new source of revenue, he added.
""The conversion of palm oil liquid waste into electricity gives economic value for the State Plantation Company III of Rp3.5 billion per year,"" he disclosed.
Other than building the Sei Mangkei biogas power plant, Pertamina NRE has also constructed a two-megawatt solar power plant (PLTS) that has the potential to reduce two thousand tons of carbon dioxide per year, he added.

""Since it was first built, the Sei Mangkei Special Economic Zone (KEK) was designated by the Government as an economic area consisting of an Industrial Zone, Logistics Zone and Tourism Zone based on Government Regulation Number 29 of 2012.
However, instead of making a profit from the Sei Mangkei SEZ, a number of problems actually occurred at the national project location.
The Indonesian BPK found that there was a mismatch between the availability of electricity and the needs of companies there, which resulted in state losses.
BPK RI Inspection Result Report (LHP) Number.34/AUDITAMA VII/PDTT/04/2022, published on April 20 2022, stated that the power supply was in accordance with the Sei Mangkei SEZ development roadmap , namely 400.5 (MW). 
However, electricity demand is lower than availability, where there are only six customers who have the potential to use electrical power in the Sei Mangke SEZ, namely the Sei Mangke Kernel Factory, PTPN III PLTBS, PT Kinra, Sei Mangkei Infrastructure Development.
Then there is PT Unilever Oleochemical Indonesia , PT Industri Nabati Lestari. 
The total power used by the six companies is only 13.8 MW.
This means that there is a difference in power between the Power Provider's plan and the Realization of -386.7 MW. 
Public Policy Observer Pratama Saragih assesses that the attractiveness of the Sei Mangkei SEZ has failed in the eyes of potential investors.
The Sei Mangkei SEZ is not being looked at for companies to stay and produce benefits for the country.
Apart from that, on a small scale, there is an element of deliberateness in determining the planning for the construction of the Main Substation (GI) in question due to inconsistency in the realization of use and planning.
""It would be very ironic if the realization of phase I power usage (MW) from 2010 to 2013 was zero. ""This is a disgraceful act, it has been accommodated and it turns out there is no result,"" said Pratama.
The owner of the Role Of The Ombudsman In Access To Justice certificate, said that the construction of a 150 kV Main Substation (GI) in Dagang, Simalungun Regency is not in accordance with the feasibility study because a project is declared feasible if the Net Benefit (net profit) is positive.
""Meanwhile, BPK RI's findings regarding the project are negative. This requires a strong warning from the Minister of BUMN and the Simalungun Regency Government, because there are state losses that are not recorded by BPK-RI where there is a difference in Megawatt (MW) supply and demand for electricity that can be converted into rupiah which has the potential to be forfeited.

(Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources, 7/9/2012, esdm.go.id: Minister of Energy and Mineral Resources Inaugurates 2 X 15 MW Biomass PLTU
""Minister of Energy and Mineral Resources (ESDM) Jero Wacik today, Monday (9/7), inaugurated 2 Biomass Steam Power Plant (PLTU) units with a capacity of 15 MW each belonging to PT Growth Asia in the Medan Industrial Area (KIM) 3, Medan, North Sumatra. PT Growth Asia is a company under the management of the Growth Steel Group (GSG) with an integrated steel industry core business.
This 2 x 15 MW Biomass PLTU was built in 2011 and uses fuel from renewable energy, namely palm shells, rice husks, corn cobs and wood dust ( Waste to Energy ).
The construction of the Biomass PLTU is basically intended to meet its own needs. However, the power produced exceeds requirements, so there is excess power of 20 MW. The excess electrical power is sold to PT. PLN (Persero) North Sumatra Region.
Previously, PT. Growth Sumatra Industry, also one of the companies under the management of the Growth Steel Group, has built 1 x 15 MW in 2008 and 1 x 15 MW in 2010. A total of 15 MW is used by itself and the excess power of 15 MW is sold to PT. PLN (Persero) North Sumatra Region.
As of June 2012, the total electrical power that has been sold by the Growth Steel Group through PT. Growth Sumatra Industry and PT. Growth Asia to PT PLN is 35 MW (from a total capacity of 60 MW). With the average price of diesel for industry being IDR. 10,000/liter and the price of electricity is IDR. 975/kWh (Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources Regulation No. 4 of 2012), then the existence of the Growth Steel Group Biomass Power Plant has resulted in savings of IDR. 621 billion/year.
By mastering the generating equipment fabrication system technology and its own workforce, PT Growth Asia has been able to create a Biomass PLTU construction with local content reaching 70%.
The construction of the Biomass PLTU, apart from increasing energy security and energy independence, is also able to reduce greenhouse gas emissions because biomass is part of renewable energy or clean energy, so that increasing the construction of the Biomass PLTU will accelerate the development of sustainable energy.
North Sumatra Province has quite a large amount of biomass waste found in oil palm plantations, other agricultural areas and in the wood industry so that the presence of the Biomass PLTU owned by the Growth Steel Group is expected to encourage other investors to build similar Biomass PLTUs which in the end will help increasing electricity supply in the North Sumatra region.""

""PT Kawasan Industri Medan (KIM) is intensifying investment in improving infrastructure and clean water services in the industrial area . This is in line with its commitment in the coordination meeting to resolve underground water use held by the Corruption Eradication Commission (KPK) together with the Ministry of Industry, North Sumatra Provincial Government (North Sumatra), Deli Serdang Regency Government, Medan City Government, and the KIM Company Association on March 17 2022 and November 23 2022. PT KIM President Director Daly Mulyana explained the progress of clean water infrastructure development and explained each progress, namely the first was the construction of the Water Treatment Plant (WTP) phase 2.
On October 19 2022, Daly said that KIM began construction of WTP phase 2 as a continuation of WTP phase 1 with a total available clean water capacity of 500,000 to 600,000 m3/month. 
""On May 3 2023, a Commissioning Test was carried out to test the operational readiness of WTP Phase 2 and is targeted to be fully operational in June 2023. As part of the Build, Operate & Transfer cooperation package, WTP Phase 2 was built by PT Dain Celicani Cemerlang, as a partner PT KIM clean water cooperation, through PT KIM supervision,"" he said in a statement quoted on Thursday (8/6/2023). Then the second is the development and utilization of underground water. In line with the Corruption Eradication Commission's direction at the coordination meeting on November 23 2022 in efforts to stop the use of groundwater in the Medan Industrial Area as well as extraordinary steps by PT KIM to meet water needs, construction and utilization of groundwater was carried out by PT KIM. 
This is in accordance with the letter from the Ministry of Industry Number B1284/KPAII.3/PWI/IV/2022 dated 14 April 2022 based on the Minister of Industry Regulation Number 40 of 2016 concerning Technical Guidelines for Industrial Area Development.  In its implementation, KIM is now synergizing with Danareksa Holding members, namely PT Jasa Tirta Luhur in building wells which will be utilized at 300,000 m3/month and distributed to tenants in the Medan Industrial Area.  ""The project began work on January 27 2023 with a contract value of IDR 22 billion and is targeted to operate in June 2023,"" he continued. The third is the collaboration between Perumda Tirtanadi. Daly explained that KIM synergized with Perumda Tirtanadi, which is the Regional Owned Enterprise (BUMD) of North Sumatra Province which serves industrial and household water needs in North Sumatra. 
He also explained that Perumda Tirtanadi is committed to serving the needs of KIM Block 1 tenants amounting to 200,000 m3/month in June 2023. Lastly, construction of reservoirs and clean water distribution networks. Daly explained that KIM invested in the construction of a reservoir (storage tank) and clean water distribution pipe network in synergy with Danareksa Holding members.  ""As a state-owned company with experience in planning, PT KIM appointed PT Indra Karya to carry out the study and PT Nindya Karya as the contractor for the construction of reservoirs and clean water distribution networks with a volume of 300,000 m3/month with a pipe length of 5 km,"" continued Daly. Through this reservoir, he said again, clean water will be stored and distributed through a network of distribution pipes to all tenants according to their needs. With an investment of around IDR 65 billion, this project is targeted for completion in June 2023. As a subsidiary of BUMN and a member of Danareksa Holding, PT KIM invests in clean water infrastructure as a form of meeting the water needs of tenants in the area. 
In line with the increase in water absorption by tenants, it is hoped that no tenants will use groundwater as is prohibited in Government Regulation Number 142 of 2015 concerning Industrial Areas.  In every investment budget preparation until its implementation, PT KIM applies the principles of prudence and Good Corporate Governance, namely referring to the regulations that apply within the BUMN environment and at Danareksa Holding as well as PT KIM's internal regulations.""

Located in lumber-and-land resource rich virgin forest, the program is positioned as based on planting, while making the most of its natural advantages to provide quality raw materials for wood and cassava products manufacturers.The project starts from the manufacturing industry (wood industry) ,expanding to the agricultural and forestry animal husbandry (quick growth forest, cassava, palm trees, fruit trees and other planting, agricultural and forestry product processing. Poultry farming, agricultural and forestry products research and development), and related manufacturing industries (paper making, palm oil, monosodium glutamate, feed, juice, freezing, etc.) logistics transportation industry, education, culture, tourism, etc.
The park has a planned area of five square kilometers and a total investment of about $800 million,which is divided into three phases of development and construction. The planned area of the first phase is 1 square kilometer from 2016 to 2019, the second phase 2 square kilometers from 2019 to 2022 while the third phase is 2 square kilometers from 2022 to 2025.
The first phase of the industrial park, with a total investment of $130 million dollars and a construction area of 1 square kilometer, is divided into two parts: infrastructure construction and housing construction with infrastructure construction mainly includes excavation of 12.5 km river channels, 13.8 km main road , 22.6km of open channel ditch,1 km embankment pier,10 bridges, 32808 square meters of square/stadium,8 power distribution rooms,1056 square meters of tap water/sewage treatment/waste treatment plants,20000 square meters of thermal power plant, 93581 square meters of wood, cassava yard as well as 300,000 square meters of greening.
The total 271760 square meters construction area is mainly used for 4346 square meters of commercial housing, 5033 square meters of hotel, 9821 square meters of staff dormitory, 6386 square meters of maintenance workshop, 5640 square meters of production auxiliary room,3545 square meters of office building and 236990 square meters of production premises.
At present, the construction of infrastructure and housing of the industrial park have been basically completed . About 70,000 square meters of factory buildings, 5,000 square meters of hotels and 30MW coal-fired power plants started construction in August ,2018 with the construction of the factory and hotel will be done in October 2019, and the power plant scheduled to start operation in February 2020 .
By August 2018, the first phase of the industrial park has been completed, and the factory and facilities have been put into use.
The industrial park began construction in 2016 and more than 20 enterprises will move in by 2019, covering varies fields including culture, education, scientific research, energy, auxiliary materials packaging, logistics and transportation,agricultural and forestry planting, breeding, cultivating, forest products processing, agricultural products and livestock products processing. By August 2018, there were already 14 enterprises setting up business in the park with an investment of about $200 million. In the future, 8 to 10 enterprises will start operating in the park, investing about $400 million dollars.
The core enterprise, BSM, undertook the installation and debugging of production equipment in 2017, and started trial operation in 2018, now having reached its production capacity. BSM expands its production line to pellet production,which is exported to Japan and South Korea, thus achieving 100% utilization of wood. Currently, the factory has 500 local employees and 30 Chinese technicians with plans to add 20 more Chinese managerial personnel and 1,000 more Indonesian employees.
Based on the 196,000 hectares of virgin forest and planting woodland owned by the enterprises in the park and the 700,000 hectares of land resources jointly developed with the local government,the cluster area of the industrial park will extend to both ends of the wood products and cassava industry chain, ultimately encompassing trees/cassava breeding and planting, logs/cassava processing,wood products/starch products production, export sales,ancillary facility agricultural and forestry technology learning, energy power generation, bio-fuel, sewage waste treatment, logistics transportation, mechanical processing, auxiliary material production and other industries, and offering one-stop service including customs, commodity inspection, bank and commercial service, hotel, living facilities, personnel and finance.
Through integration of upstream and downstream industrial chain of agricultural and forestry products, the enterprises within the park aims for gradual expansion of improved seed cultivation, supply and large-scale planting, which will not only solve the problem of raw material supply, but also help to form a whole circular industrial chain of agricultural and forestry product research and development, seedling cultivation, agricultural and forestry planting, product production and export, thus ultimately improving the ability of overseas assets to resist risks. As a result of resource and labor cost advantages, when products are shipped back to China for sale, it reduces production cost for enterprises on the one hand and increases tax revenue for the country on the other hand.
Phase two, phase three of the project will copy the first phase of the project model, at the same time continuing to expand the planting and manufacturing scale,introducing breeding enterprises, fertilizer factories, alcohol plants, sugar refineries, seedling breeding firms, agricultural machinery repair companies, agricultural technology training centers, etc. By 2025, when the five-square-kilometer industrial park is completed construction and fully put into operation, it is expected to generate $12 billion in sales and $1.5 billion in tax revenue for the Chinese government every year. In addition, the development of agroforestry eco-tourism will also be carried out to make Ketapang a featured demonstration city integrating agroforestry planting, ecological cultivation, agroforestry processing and ecological tourism.Based on the principle of protective use of natural resources, prioritizing environmental protection and rational utilization of ecological resources, facilitating trade, we strive to build a modern agricultural, forestry,ecological tourism industry clusters harmonizing agricultural, forestry and animal husbandry cultivation with agricultural, forestry and animal husbandry production base, seasonal scientific planting, agricultural and forest product processing and ecological tourism, making Ketapang industrial park a model project of ""One Belt And One Road"" agricultural and forestry cooperation between China and Indonesia.""

""Land that is not yet productive can be used to plant cassava. Moreover, investors have now entered who are ready to manage the cassava agricultural products,"" he said when contacted in Ketapang, West Kalimantan, Wednesday.
He mentioned investors who had entered Ketapang and were engaged in the tapioca flour industry, namely PT Ketapang Ecology and Agriculture Forestry Industrial Park (KEAFIP). The company's investors come from China.
""This investor is setting up a factory and plans to invest trillions of rupiah. One of the fields that will be worked on is the tapioca flour and glue industry which requires a supply of cassava raw materials. In driving economic potential, the community can take advantage of this opportunity by planting cassava which will be accommodated by the company,"" he said.
Currently, the Ketapang Regency Government through the Ketapang Agriculture, Food Crops and Forestry Service and the Ketapang Culture and Tourism Service together with PT KREAFIP have also signed the cooperation agreement.
""The collaboration between the government and the company is related to cultivating farmers and supplying cassava,"" he said.
Director of PT KEAFIP Yu Yiping explained that 30 years ago the city of Suzhou, China, was more or less the same as the condition of Ketapang today. The presence of the company investing in Ketapang is expected to develop Ketapang.
""In investing we will focus on planting and processing,"" he said.
In looking for investment locations, his party has been in Indonesia since 2000. However, from the various regions explored, Ketapang Regency was considered to provide good service and received support from regional heads in exploring the community's economic potential.
""Moreover, the land here is suitable for planting jabon, albizia, cassava, rice and corn. However, here we see seeds that are not good so we will invite professors and experts to do research,"" he said.
To overcome the seed problem, a 30 hectare nursery area will also be built at the company location with an investment of around IDR 30 billion.

(oboarkeadilan.com, 12/02/2018): DEVELOPMENT OF INDUSTRIAL AREA AND PORT PROJECT OWNED BY PT. BORNEO ALUMINDO PRIMA (HANGZHOU JINJIANG GROUP) WAS ALLEGEDLY BUILT USING FILLED MATERIALS FROM ILLEGAL EXCAVATIONS
The aluminum factory and special port construction project located in Pagar Mentimun Village, Matan Hilir Selatan District, Ketapang Regency, this is in accordance with the Ketapang Regent's Land Information Decree Number 654.1/35/DPU-E covering an area of ​​2,340 hectares and the Ketapang Regent's location permit decree Number 249/PEM/2013 covering an area of ​​1,150 hectares, which is managed by PT. BORNEO ALUMINDO PRIMA and PT. KETAPANG BANGUN PRIMA which are companies incorporated in HANGZHOU JINJIANG GROUP CO., LTD which is based in the city of Lin'an, Zhejiang province, China.
In this project, HANGZHOU JINJIANG GROUP CO., LTD in the initial stage invested funds amounting to 1,250 million USD which was intended for the construction of an industrial area, an aluminum factory with a capacity of 4.5 million tons per year, the construction of a 15 x 25 MW PLTU and the construction of a special port.
It is planned that the aluminum industry which is managed by the company PT. BORNEO ALUMINDO PRIMA, whose raw material is bouxite, will be supplied by 9 companies including Pt. Tamindo Mutiara Perkasa, Pt. Fortuna Jaya Makmur, Pt. Kindai Mandiri Sejahtera 290, Pt. Kindai Mandiri Sejahtera 291, Pt. Agrabudi Gasutama Prima, Pt. Cakrawala Mandiri Sedaya, Pt. Tayan Alumina Abadi and Pt. Meliau Ratu Abadi with a total production plan of 10 million tons per year.
The construction that is currently being carried out is still at the land preparation stage, including land clearing work as well as filling and other initial construction work, but what is very unfortunate is that the supply of materials used for filling work is suspected to have been supplied from unofficial or illegal excavation sites. Based on research by national media OBORKEADILAN.COM, the mining location for the stockpiled material comes from behind the Miftaluh Ulum Islamic boarding school, Gayam hamlet, Sungai Gantang Village, Kendawangan District, where the location also belongs to the Islamic boarding school foundation.
According to the confession of one of the administrators of the Miftaluh Ulum Islamic boarding school foundation, who did not want to be named, he said that ""the excavation does not have a mining permit nor does it have an environmental permit as it should, but the fees obtained from the sale of the laterite land will be used to build the development of the Islamic boarding school facilities."" he said. 
Meanwhile, according to Ibrahim, Myh, who is the coordinator of the Nusantara Corruption Watch (NCW) for the West Kalimantan region, said that the laterite mining activity did not have a Mining Business Permit (IUP) in accordance with Law Number 4 of 2009 concerning Mineral and Coal Mining (Minerba) as well. Government Regulation (PP) Number 23 of 2010 concerning the Implementation of Mineral and Coal Mining Business Activities, along with Law Number 28 of 2009 concerning Taxes and Levies and what is no less important is the existence of an environmental permit from the Kendawangan district government or the West Kalimantan Regency Government, however ""None of these things are owned by the excavation manager,"" he said irritably.
Monitoring in the field of excavation activities using excavator type heavy equipment and transported by dozens of dump truck type vehicles going back and forth to the landfill site via public roads which created dust and no watering activities were carried out by the management of excavation C. According to several residents, the excavation was coordinated by someone named Mr. Deril alias Maxklem alias Mc lean D. Meray is suspected of being a thug and is the third hand in collecting PT. BORNEO ALUMINDO PRIMA's laterite excavation.
At a different time, in the room of the Ketapang Police Chief, AKBP Yuri Nurhidayat, when confirmed by several media crew regarding the existence of mining activities that did not have legality, in one statement he said, ""You need to know that the issue of permitting Excavation C in our area is very complicated and takes a long time. In the Kendawangan area and its surroundings, there are no business entities or individuals who have a C mining business permit that have received a production permit. I have raised this issue at the Forkopimda meeting. ""C mining/excavation activities may not have a permit as long as they are not supplied outside the area or are not bought and sold outside the area and the issue of controlling mining that does not have a permit is the authority of the local government through Satpol PP,"" he said. 
Until the time this news was published, excavation activities supplied to industrial and port construction sites managed by PT BORNEO ALUMINDO PRIMA were still ongoing even though the materials used were sourced from excavations that did not have clear legality in accordance with the provisions of Government Regulation No. 1 of 2014 regarding the second amendment to PP no. 23 of 2010 concerning the implementation of mineral and coal mining business activities, Law Number 4 of 2009 concerning Mineral and Coal Mining (State Gazette of the Republic of Indonesia of 2009 Number 4, Supplement to the State Gazette of the Republic of Indonesia Number 49), Law Number 32 of 2009 concerning Environmental Protection and Management (State Gazette of the Republic of Indonesia of 2009 Number 140, Supplement to the State Gazette of the Republic of Indonesia Number 5059).""",0,0,1,0,1,0,Aluminum,"Alumina to bauxite processing, transport of raw materials and industrial products, construction and operation of ports

(Rahayu, 1/19/2023, industri.kontan.co.id): ""...At the end of 2022, Citra Borneo Utama will officially carry out corporate action in the form of an Initial Public Offering (IPO) on the Indonesia Stock Exchange (BEI) in order to obtain fresh funds for expansion.
In connection with this corporate action, CBUT received IDR 431.25 billion by offering 625 million shares or 20% of the issued and fully paid capital.
Of the fresh funds obtained, 54% will be used for the construction of the refinery extension and infrastructure. This refinery extension is located in the Surya Borneo Industrial Area and is planned to be built in the first quarter of 2023 and will only be completed in the first quarter of 2025.
With this refinery extension, crude palm kernel oil or Crude Palm Kernel Oil (CPKO) will be processed into RBDPKO (Refined Bleached Deodorized Palm Kernel Oil) into raw materials for cocoal butter and PKFAD (Palm Kernel Palm Fatty Acid Distillate) which has business prospects which is more promising.
PT Citra Borneo Utama Tbk Corporate Secretary Deni Agustinus said that in 2023 Citra Borneo's business prospects will remain good. This is because local and export demand for olein is still high.
""Meanwhile, the supply of raw materials, CPO, is limited due to the B35 provisions,"" he explained some time ago.
Deni explained that these supply and demand conditions have caused prices to stabilize and there is a possibility of rising again if demand from export destination countries such as China and India increases ahead of celebrations in the near future.
Apart from relying on CPO derivative products such as olein, Citra Borneo Utama will also encourage sales of cooking oil. CBUT can produce 400,958 tons of cooking oil a year.""

(MMC Kobar, 9/18/2022, mmc.kotawaringinbaratkab.go.id): ""(Saturday, 17/09), the Regional Development Planning Agency for Research and Development (Bappedalitbang) of Central Kalimantan Province (Kalteng) on ​​Saturday (17/9) made a working visit to West Kotawaringin Regency (Kobar) to see the development of the Industrial Area Surya Borneo (KISB)...
Meanwhile, Director of PT Surya Borneo Industry (SBI) Agus Dwitarto explained, KSB has been operating since 2018. The development of the industrial area has been reported to the Central Government through the Kobar Bappeda.
""Based on the self-assessment, around 80 percent of the requirements mandated by Law Number 39 of 2009 concerning Special Economic Zones have been fulfilled,"" said Agus.
Agus added that PT SBI had met with the Governor of Malaysia to open a partnership with Malaysia regarding derivatives from CPO products. Future plans for PT SBI will build a container depot, logistics center, and  will carry out a consortium with Pelindo, PT Wilmar, Jass Marine .
Central Kalimantan Bappedalitbang Kaspinor explained, since five years ago assistance from Central Kalimantan Provincial Public Works has entered Kobar Regency to support this KISB, namely the construction of a road from the Pangkalan Lima roundabout to KISB (Regency road assisted by the Province). Around IDR 20 billion is still needed to build roads that are still damaged for approximately 1.3 km.
""These coordination meetings and field visits were held in order to speed up the coordination process. Collaboration is easy to say but not easy to implement,"" said Kaspinor.
""I have been appointed as Head of the Water Resources Management Coordination Team, Irrigation Team and others from the Center as a result of the area being designated as a development priority by the Center,"" he added.
Therefore, Kaspinor continued, in order to find out in more detail the conditions and situation in the field, coordination meetings and visits to the regions were also needed in order to synergize the vision of the government, private sector and BUMN, including cooperatives. Pancasila as an ideology is not only memorized, but also must be applied in the life of the nation and state to realize the Pancasila economy.
Kaspinor also said that PT SBI has become one of the leading companies in Central Kalimantan Province. For this reason, the provincial government is very supportive of industrial development. It is hoped that this industry will have an environmental perspective and local wisdom, taking into account water resources and air pollution in anticipation of the impacts that could arise later.
""It is hoped that this industry will have a big impact on the people of Central Kalimantan,"" he stated.

""PT PLN (Persero) is strengthening the electricity network in South Kalimantan by adding three capacitors with a total capacity of 75 Megavolt Ampere Reactive (MVAr). This step was taken to increase voltage levels, especially for industrial customers.
General Manager of PLN's Kalimantan Main Generation and Distribution Unit (UIKL), Daniel Eliawardhana, said that the growth of the industrial sector in South Kalimantan was accompanied by high demand for high voltage consumer power .
""The installation of these capacitors aims to serve the needs of industrial customers of 115 MVA which will be connected this August and several other potential customers,"" said Daniel.
He said that the growth of the extractive industry sector in Kalimantan was very high, so PLN needed to take strategic steps, especially to maintain the quality of service to customers in accordance with agreed service standards.

""To maintain the quality of service voltage, we carried out grid reinforcement by optimizing the role of capacitors in two locations, namely the Batulicin Main Substation (GI) and Pulau Laut, Kotabaru,"" he detailed.
Work on installing the capacitors has been ongoing since early 2022 and the three capacitors were successfully operated at the end of last July.
Based on an evaluation carried out by PLN, the three installed capacitors succeeded in increasing voltage levels and the reliability of electricity distributed to high voltage consumers.
""We hope that improving the quality of voltage around Batulicin and Pulau Laut will support the productivity of industrial customers there,"" concluded Daniel.
Currently, South Kalimantan's electricity system is in surplus condition with a power reserve of more than 300 MW. PLN is optimistic that the abundant availability of electricity will greatly support the acceleration of domestic economic and industrial recovery after the pandemic.""

(Apahabar Banjarmasin, 4/12/2022, banjarmasin.apahabar.com): ""The reliability of an electricity system that is of good quality and meets standards is one of the things that is very important for life today. The role of electricity has become very dominant in the fields of industry, banking, health, telecommunications, and even security which currently operates with electrical energy.
This is what also underlies PT PLN (Persero), the East Kalimantan Main Development Unit (UIP Kalbagtim) continuing to commit to developing electricity infrastructure to provide quality electrical energy, with efforts to build a 150 kV Batulicin - Tarjun High Voltage Overhead Line (SUTT). which is located in Tanah Bumbu Regency, South Kalimantan.
Moreover, with the establishment of the National Capital of the Archipelago (IKN) which is located in North Penajam Paser in the East Kalimantan region, it is necessary to strengthen and increase the reliability of the South Kalimantan - East Kalimantan electricity interconnection system, because construction of the Tarjun Main Substation will later continue to Tanah Grogot in East Kalimantan. .
Welcoming PLN's UIP Kalbagtim plan, Jhonlin Group, whose land is also crossed by the Batulicin 150 kV SUTT construction - Tarjun stated that he had no objections. This was conveyed during coordination between PLN UIP Kalbagtim management and Jhonlin group management representatives some time ago.
Jhonlin Group Management representative, Irwan, said that his party fully supports the construction of this SUTT. Because the need for electricity can support the growth of industrial areas in Tanah Bumbu. Apart from that, it can also create jobs along with the development of industry in Tanah Bumbu Regency.
Senior Manager of Licensing, Land and Communications at PLN UIP Kalbagtim, Basuki Rahman, added that if it is impossible for PLN to complete the 150 kV Batulicin - Tarjun SUTT alone, of course synergy between various parties, stakeholders and the community is needed so that this development can run smoothly.
""We have met with representatives of the Jhonlin group management. The Jhonlin Group is ready to support the National Strategic Project carried out by PLN in the construction of the Batulicin-Tarjun 150 kV SUTT. Regarding land acquisition, we have agreed and work in the field has started,"" said Basuki.
Furthermore, he hopes that the successful construction of the Batulicin - Tarjun transmission network will be able to improve the quality of service for customers with a more reliable electricity supply and minimize blackouts.
Manager of PLN UPP Kalbagtim 4, Arie Nugroho Ardianto, said that with approval from the Jhonlin Group, a total of 115 towers on the Batulicin - Tarjun route are 100% free, with 108 foundations already completed, further emphasizing that this construction can be completed by the middle of this year.

""Construction of a nickel S melter with a capacity of 40,000 tons per year belonging to PT Anugerah Barokah Cakrawala (ABC) has begun.  Ground breaking was held in Sungai Dua Village, Simpang Empat District, Tanah Bumbu Regency, South Kalimantan (25/7/2022).
The ABC nickel smelter was built on 329 hectares of land or is included in the Special Economic Zone (KEK) belonging to the Jhonlin Group.
CEO of Jhonlin Group, Ghimoyo, said that the nickel smelter would prioritize absorbing local workers or residents of Tanah Bumbu Regency. ""Especially for the ABC nickel smelter, it will be able to absorb a workforce of approximately 1,200 people,"" said Ghimoyo in his official statement.
For raw materials or nickel ore, Ghimoyo said it was imported from within the country and from abroad. The nickel ore will later be processed at the ABC smelter into batteries. ""The ore sources for the ABC smelter come from Sulawesi, Kalimantan and Australia,"" explained Ghimoyo.
Ghimoyo added that the investment value for the construction of the ABC nickel smelter would require a large budget. ""The investment is around IDR 6 trillion and construction is targeted to be completed in the next 12 to 18 months,"" he added.

(VOI, 4/11/2022, voi.id): KRAS's Subsidiary, Meratus Jaya Iron & Steel, Will Soon Be Dissolved, Krakatau Steel's Managing Director Silmy Karim Reveals The Reason
""JAKARTA - President Director of PT Krakatau Steel Tbk, Silmy Karim said that his party will immediately liquidate or dissolve PT Meratus Jaya Iron & Steel (MJIS). This step is because the company is considered no longer efficient to continue.
The dissolution of one of the listed subsidiaries with the stock code KRAS has received the blessing of the Minister of State-Owned Enterprises (BUMN) Erick Thohir.
Silmy explained that before the liquidation was carried out, his party first looked for partners or business partners. Unfortunately, he did not explain further the link between the liquidation of MJIS and the management's efforts to find new business partners.
""Currently MJIS has received approval to be liquidated, but before this liquidation is executed, we are looking for partners,"" said Silmy in a Hearing Meeting (RDP) with Commission VI DPR RI, Monday, April 11.
For your information, MJIS is a joint venture between Krakatau Steel and PT Aneka Tambang Tbk (ANTM), Meratus Jaya Iron &. This company was founded on June 9, 2008. The company is engaged in the industry and steel products, trade and services related to steel.
MJIS is located in South Kalimantan by utilizing local iron ore reserves. In 2012, the company operated one unit of an iron factory (rotary kiln) from the planned two units, with a total capacity of 315,000 tons of direct reduced iron (DRI) per year.
The rotary kiln unit produces sponge iron which is processed from local iron ore. Meanwhile, the power plant has produced electricity using gas fuel from the rotary kiln factory unit. When it reaches full capacity, the electricity produced is 18 MW. In collaboration with PLN, this excess electricity will be distributed to the surrounding communities and small industries.
However, MJIS experienced problems in its operation, in the form of limited infrastructure and delays in delivery of goods, installation and assembling of equipment. Because there was a commitment from the contractor PT Krakatau Engineering and shareholders, ANTM and KRAS were finally able to overcome these obstacles.
""But this can't be used because it's already inefficient and the location is far from further production,"" he said.
Quoted from the Meratus Jaya website, this company has been operating since 2008 and has stopped operating due to falling iron ore prices on the world market. Thus, the selling price is not competitive.
This company has also been in production for approximately 3 years and has made the first shipment of sponge iron products of 5,000 metric tons to Krakatau Steel.
""Krakatau Steel itself, we no longer use sponge iron,"" he said.""

(Trihusodo, 11/1/2021, Indonesia.go.id): Bright Industrial Prospects in Batulicin
""A biodiesel plant operates in the Batulicin Industrial area. In the same place, the iron ore smelter is being revitalized. ""The government continues to push for an increase in biodiesel.
In the third week of August 2021, President Jokowi inaugurated a biodiesel factory in the Batulicin City industrial area, Tanah Bumbu Regency, South Kalimantan Province. The factory, which stands on an industrial area of ​​2,000 ha, is directly connected to the beach. The factory processes crude palm oil (CPO) into 1,500 tons of biodiesel per day, and was built with an investment of IDR 2 trillion.
The Batulicin biofuel industry is owned by Haji Isam, the popular name of businessman Syamsudin Andi Arsyad, who is known as the richest man and concurrently the coal king of South Kalimantan. ''I am willing to come here because this industry can open up great job opportunities,'' President Jokowi said in his remarks.
Second, he continued, the downstream industry can maintain the stability of palm oil prices, both in the domestic and international markets. Palm oil has a wider market. ''That way, the price can be more stable. Don't let our goods be owned, but the market will determine the price,'' said President Jokowi.
President Jokowi also said that the Jhonlin Group's initiative to build a biodiesel factory was a downstream step for raw commodities that had to be encouraged. The head of state also hopes that PT Jhonlin and other business groups can conduct downstream activities more broadly. ''Either used as cooking oil, cosmetics, or other finished goods. I appreciate what PT Jhonlin Group has done, which certainly provides great added value,' said Jokowi...
Industrial area
In his report to President Jokowi, Commissioner of PT Jhonlin Agro Raya Andi Amran Sulaiman, (former Indonesian Minister of Agriculture 2014-2019), said that the biodiesel industry in Batulicin, with all its supporting industries upstream, can absorb up to 20,000 workers. There are thousands of others who are indirectly related to the industrial business.
It is also believed that the biodiesel industry will revive the prestige of the dim Batulicin Industrial Area. The industrial area itself is part of the PT Jhonlin Group business. According to Amran, the smelter will operate again in the area which will process iron sand (iron rock) into iron billets for the steel industry. The raw material for iron sand and iron stone itself is quite a lot in South Kalimantan, especially on Derawan Island, Sebuku Island, besides there are many others available in Central Sulawesi.
The smelter industry Amran Sulaiman refers to belongs to PT Meratus Jaya Iron and Steel (MJIS), a joint venture between two BUMNs, namely PT Krakatau Steel (Persero) Tbk and PT Aneka Tambang Tbk . The smelter operated for several years before closing in 2015 due to falling steel prices on the market. Occupying an area of ​​120 ha in Batulicin, the smelter owned by PT Meratus Jaya is currently being revitalized and is expected to return to production in 2023.
The Batulicin Industrial Area is one of 120 industrial areas in Indonesia, and the only one in South Kalimantan. It is not surprising that the South Kalimantan Provincial Government and Tanah Bumbu Regency Government have encouraged the industrial area to continue to develop.
Currently, Kotabaru Port in Batulicin has entered the sea highway network, and is one of 33 ports in the sea highway network equipped with Inaportnet 4.0 infrastructure. Kotabaru Port has also been equipped with warehouses, passenger terminals, container terminals, and can serve ships with large tonnages. Bersujud Airport in Batulicin City also has a runway that is 1,850 meters long, only an additional 100-200 meters is needed for Boeing 737s to land on it.
However, compared to those standing in East Kalimantan, the Batulicin Industrial Area is still quiet. Apart from the biodiesel factory, cooking oil factory and iron ore smelter which are currently being restored using the latest technology, the Batulicin Industrial Area is only inhabited by a handful of medium-scale factories. PT Jhonlin Group, for example, also operates a rubber and wood pellet processing industry, from wood industry waste, which is used as fuel for heating stoves in four-season homes. The wood pellets are exported to Europe.
There are still many industries that can be accommodated. The need for clean water for industry is easy to obtain. Electricity supply is also available in sufficient quantities, available from the Barito power grid, with the back pole of the Bengkanai PLTG in Central Kalimantan.
President Jokowi also reminded the importance of upholding the commitment to abandon fossil energy and switch to new, renewable energy. Therefore, the President encouraged biodiesel production to continue to be increased. Andi Amran Sulaiman, as the Main Commissioner of PT Jhonlin Agro Raya, has invited industry players to enter Batulicin.
The biodiesel industry itself will continue to develop in the country. 'In 2021, our target is to be able to produce and distribute 9.2 million kiloliters, and I hope that next year it can increase even higher,"" said President Jokowi. PT Jhonlin's biodiesel factory may be facing a fairly bright business situation.""",Operational with Continued Construction,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,,1,1,0,0,1,0,Palm Oil,"Palm oil (large biodiesel factory), nickel smelter under construction","PT.

The area is currently undergoing the second stage of land clearing in preparation for actual construction of the plant to begin. The facility is targeted for completion by late 2025 or early 2026.
Under an initial agreement by both companies, Bumi will supply coal for the facility through its Kaltim Prima Coal (KPC) mining subsidiary and its Ithaca Resources' Kaltim Nusantara Coal subsidiary. Both companies will be responsible for the offtake of the methanol produced, while Air Products will be the builder, owner, and operator of the facility.
Indonesia's energy ministry (ESDM) welcomed the development of the new gasification facility, saying that these types of projects will help accelerate investments in the growing downstream coal sector.
Investments remain low because of the significant financial undertaking needed, as well as the lack of an existing market for coal derivative products, the ESDM said. The ESDM is hoping that the commercial operations of two large-scale coal gasification plants will demonstrate the economic feasibility of the downstream coal sector to industry players.
The methanol produced by the plant is expected to help reduce imports, and increase the value of lower-quality coal produced in Indonesia.""

""The government has started the construction of a coal gasification industry into dimethyl ether (DME) in East Kutai. The downstream industry for processing black gold into methanol is targeted to be completed in 2024. Academics have requested that policy makers prioritize local workers in this project.
To kaltimkece.id mediakaltim.com network, Tuesday, April 19 2022, the Head of the One-Stop Investment and Integrated Services Service (DPMPTSP), Puguh Harjanto, reported the progress of the construction of the coal gasification industry. Currently, the work is entering the land clearing stage at the Batuta Chemical Industrial Park (BCIP), Bengalon, East Kutai.
""We are currently in the second phase of the land clearing process. The construction has already been prepared,"" said Puguh when met at the Odah Etam Hall, Samarinda.
For information, the gasification project is being undertaken by PT Bakrie Capital Indonesia (BCI) and PT Ithaca Resources and Air Products from the United States. The project value is around USD 2 billion or IDR 30 trillion (exchange rate IDR 14,900/USD). If this project is completed, PT Bumi Resources TBK (BUMI) through its subsidiary, PT Kaltim Prima Coal, will become the supplier of the coal needs. The projected amount of coal is 6 million tons per year.
""This is included in the downstream strategy and increasing added value. God willing, we will control it,"" Puguh added.
Still at the Odah Etam Hall, the East Kutai Regent, Ardiansyah, confirmed that the construction of a methanol processing plant is underway in his area. The project belongs to BCIP. Based on information received by Ardiansyah, the construction is targeted to be completed in 2024.

The development is situated on the coastline of Makassar Strait and is planned to establish an integrated industrial development, which stimulates profitable business, especially for the coal industry. As a new profitable industrial park development, this project has three main success factors for the development strategy to establish a comprehensive industrial park. 
First, the development shall provide an integrated infrastructure network. Second, the development shall accommodate a self-sustained industrial estate development, and third, the development shall be planned to be the center of excellence in new coal processing.
The realization of these success factors requires the implementation of design principles that create a clear and functional development structure, flexible land parcels, green and blue infrastructure, and efficient phasing on the clustering.
Half of the approximately 943,8 hectares land area is designed to serve industrial programs. These programs are clustered based on coal processing and are part of Industrial Land, which will be sold out to investors. On the other hand, the Small Medium Enterprise (SME) area, which is part of the Industrial Building, will be rented out.

Until now, there are around 20 factories that have obtained permits to build factories, of which 13 are already operating, absorbing around 4,000 workers. Companies that are already operating include those engaged in CPO (Crude Palm Oil) processing, mining, coal and oil and gas, shipping industry, metal industry, wood textiles, and warehousing. In carrying out its functions, the Kariangau Industrial Estate is supported by container terminal infrastructure, power plants, access roads, bridges and toll roads.
The construction of the Kariangau international container terminal for container loading and unloading activities, general cargo, including coal, with an investment value of Rp. 713 billion occupies an area of around 57.5 ha. The terminal capacity is capable of accommodating 17,000 TEUs (twenty-foot equivalent units) of containers or around 17.5 million tonnes per year. Currently, the construction of a 282 m trestle with a width of 10.5 m has been completed, while the construction of a 1.5 km wharf is under construction.

Electrical System Integration (ESI) is a unit that functions to distribute electrical power from several factory generators in the PT Pupuk Kalimantan Timur Industrial Area. Electrical power from each generator can be used for the needs of each factory. With the ESI Unit, electrical power from one factory can be used for other factories via the Main Ring Unit.
The ESI unit was built by KDM in 2007 and is very useful for continuing production in factories in the PT Pupuk Kalimantan Timur Industrial Area. This is because if the electricity generator of one of the factories connected to the ESI Unit experiences a problem and results in it tripping or shutting down, then the electricity consumption at that factory can be supplied from another factory's generator.

According to the Sambalagi Community Coordinator, Irfan Mualim, PT ATI's presence in Sambalagi Village is expected to have a positive impact, not only on improving the economy of the local community.
""However, the economic impact has never been seen, only the impact of pollution and the noise that exists after the demolition of several mountains in Sambalagi Village,"" said Irfan Mualim, in his written statement, Tuesday (17/1/2023).
Furthermore, he said, heavy equipment continues to roar non-stop 1 x 24 hours, disrupting people's sleep. Even the encroachment of mangrove forests (mangroves) and seagrass beds (lelamo) poses a real threat to Sambalagi Village due to natural disasters.
""In fact, in several areas, mangroves and lelamo are also protected and President Joko Widodo has often called for them to be protected together for the benefit of the community. ""Therefore, it would not be wrong if the people of Sambalagi Village asked PT Anugrah Tambang Industri to conduct socialization regarding plans for industrial area development activities in collaboration with PT Vale Indonesia,"" he said.
He explained that in July 2022, the Sambalagi Village Government had sent a letter to the leadership of PT Anugrah Tambang Industri regarding the request for this socialization. However, in various meetings held, the leadership of PT ATI and the Sambalagi Village aparta only made promises.
""In fact, we held a public consultation at the Lafeu Village Office, a sub-district location which was attended by the Regent of Morowali and the Head of Bungku Pesisir Sub-District.

However, the Head of the Public Relations Department of PT Anugrah Tambang Industri, Margono alias Ahong, replied to the Sambalagi Village Government's letter which disappointed the Sambalagi community.
The contents of the letter are for the Sambalagi Village Government to write to the Regent of Morowali to facilitate requests for community outreach to PT Anugrah Tambang Industri. This is impressive, because the Regent of Morowali was the facilitator of this socialization activity.
""As far as we know, socialization is a necessity that must be carried out by every company when they want to carry out activities in the village,"" he explained.
He added that socialization also makes local people know and understand what will be built or erected in the village. So that society can face the impacts that will occur.
""Because of this, we, the people of Sambalag Village, have asked PT Anugrah Tambang Industri to temporarily stop mountain demolition activities before carrying out outreach to the Sambalag Village community,"" he stressed.

(Asiatoday, 3/22/2023, asiatoday.id): The Morosi Nickel Industrial Area is Turbulent, 2 Groups of PT VDNI and PT OSS Workers Clash
A tense situation occurred in the Morosi nickel industrial area, Konawe Regency, Southeast Sulawesi.
Two groups of workers working at PT Virtue Dragon Nickel Industry (VDNI) and PT Obsdian Stainless Steel (OSS) were involved in a clash on Wednesday (22/3/2023).
The clash was triggered by a strike by thousands of workers held by the National Workers' Union (KSPN) and the Labor Protection Union (SPTK). This action sparked a reaction of resistance from opposing labor groups. As a result, clashes were inevitable.
Hundreds of police officers intervened to mediate between the two warring camps.
The workers' strike action was to urge the management of PT VDNI and PT OSS to provide family allowances, transportation allowances and housing allowances to workers. The workers also asked the company to carry out Collective Labor Agreement (PKB) negotiation procedures in accordance with Minister of Manpower Regulation (Permenaker) No. 28 of 2014, and urged the central management leadership to remove the HRD position of PT. OSS and PT. VDNI in Morosi.
For your information, these two nickel refining companies, PT VDNI and PT OSS, are located in the Morosi industrial area. PT VDNI was founded in 2014 and is a subsidiary of De Long Nickel Co Ltd which originates from Jiangsu, China. This company invested tens of trillions of rupiah to build a smelter facility with modern technology. Its production capacity is 600,000-800,000 tons of nickel pig iron per year. Until the end of 2018, PT VDNI had contributed US$142.2 million to Indonesian exports.
The parent companies of PT OSS are Hong Kong Xiangyu Hansheng Co Ltd and Singapore Xiangyu Hansheng Pte Ltd. This company was founded in 2016 in an area of ​​398 hectares with an investment value of US$ 2 billion. Since 2018, this company has applied for a principle permit to build a 400,000 ton stainless steel production facility, 800,000 ton steel lab and 800,000 ton ferronickel. To date, PT OSS has built 17 smelter furnaces out of the planned 30 furnaces.
Meanwhile, Arys Nirwana, Head of Human Resources Department PT VDNI and PT OSS, in his release explained that what was conveyed by the action participants did not match the facts. This is because, for example, the company has good intentions and is open to discussing this matter as long as the labor union fulfills the requirements in accordance with applicable laws and regulations.
In every meeting held at the company, at the Konawe Regency Manpower Office and the Provincial DPRD Hearing Meeting, the company complied with the summons and acted cooperatively.
For wage demands, the company's payroll system refers to statutory regulations and company regulations/policies. Employees can check this on their respective pay slips, instead of referring to a website that doesn't know who made it. The actions of the trade unions which use this as a reason for the strike are baseless.
""In the previously circulated action circular, the things conveyed in the notification letter are untrue, unfounded, and tend to provoke and disturb company employees who intend to work seriously to support their families and to develop their abilities and competencies. as well as professionalism in work,"" he explained.

Environmental Justice Atlas, 4/10/2022: ""Residents that live close to Delong Nickel Smelter began to complain about the pollution from coal dust after the coal-fired power plants began operation [7]. These involve at least 6 villages:  Sama Subur, Wawoluri, Puuwonggia, Ranombopulu, Motui and Lambuluo. It was reported that the coal dust regularly blows up to 3 kilometers away from the power station and affects households both indoors and outdoors [7]. Children in the area began coughing and having respiratory problems [7].  A written complaint signed by 15 village heads was submitted to PT Obsidian Stainless Steel (OSS) [7]. Baharudin, Head of Motui Village, said the black dust was very disturbing to residents' activities and that a lot of dust began to fly since the beginning of the previous August [7]. Roni Syukur, Head of Mining Engineering (KTT) of PT OSS, admitted that the black particles felt by residents were from coal and that the construction of the belt conveyor is in process to address the issue of coal dust from transportation [7].
A number of violent protests by workers at the Delong industrial work took place towards the end of 2020, one of which paralyzed the operations of Delong’s Virtue Dragon nickel smelter plant [8], [9]. A protest involved 800 workers calling for higher salaries and better working conditions e.g. permanent employment for contractors. When management refused to meet with the protestors, the demonstrators began destroying company property. Significant damage was inflicted up on the nickel production facilities, and about 40 pieces of heavy equipment were set on fire and destroyed[3], [4], [8].""

(Ungku & Christina, 12/16/2020, reuters.com): ""Violent protests by hundreds of workers at one of Indonesia’s biggest nickel smelters on Sulawesi island operated by PT Virtue Dragon Nickel Industry (PT VDNI) had “paralysed” its activities, the China-backed company said in a statement.
The protest, which saw 800 workers calling for higher salaries and permanent employment for contractors, turned violent on Monday, as workers torched vehicles and buildings.
“The rioting resulted in company activities being paralysed because the factory supporting equipment was badly damaged and about 40 heavy equipment and operational vehicles belonging to the company caught fire,” PT VDNI, a unit of China’s Jiangsu Delong Nickel Industry, said in a statement late on Tuesday."" 

Environmental Impact:
Smoke and coal dust from power plant resulting in respiratory problems, contaminated water hurting local fish supply, mud flooding during wet season, trash accumulation

(Pulitzer Center, 1/23/2023, pulitzercenter.org): ""... When Virtue Dragon Nickel Industry built the smelter there eight years ago, people from around Morosi went there hoping to make money. Economic opportunities grew when Obsidian Stainless Steel officially opened a nickel smelter last year. The two companies are subsidiaries of Xiangyu and the Delong Group, a Chinese business alliance. Obsidian has a production capacity of over 2.5 million tons of nickel per year. Virtue Dragon has a production capacity of over 1 million tons annually. Those two factories produce nickel pig iron (NPI), ferronickel, and nickel matte. Those three nickel ore products are components for making steel. As of the third quarter of 2021, Obsidian exported over 800,000 tons of NPI worth Rp24.5 trillion. Virtue Dragon exported 618,117 metric tons worth Rp17 trillion over that same period. In addition to stimulating the economy outside the factory gates, those two large smelters provide a lot of jobs. La Ode Muhammad Alihaswandy, Chief of the Office of Transmigration and Labor of Southeast Sulawesi, said that out of 25,281 workers at those two smelters, 1,893 are from China. “The mining sector accounts for 2.9 percent of workers,” he said. According to Alihaswandy, the opening of shops is but one domino effect from the construction of nickel smelters in Morosi. Residents rent out boarding rooms or houses, open restaurants, workshops, and other commercial facilities. Newly built shops sprouted up along the road in Morosi... The growth in economy in Southeast Sulawesi due to this nickel mining activity has created a new problem: trash accumulation. In addition to the high amount of street dust and smoke resulting from the burning of coal to power the ore processing plant, trash scatters on the streets around the market or vendor shops, and is even found in the river and swamps. It appears that the local government has not made any plans in response to the impact of this sudden economic change. While most of the vendors come from outside of Morosi, locals tend to become factory workers or work side jobs in addition to their company jobs. Residents of Mandiodo, Tapuemea, and Tapunggaya villages no longer work as fishermen. They have gone to work in the factories or have taken up nickel mining. According to Ratna Kasim, head of neighborhood unit (RT) 4 in Tapunggaya village, of the 32 heads of households in her area only two still remain as fishermen. Her husband is paid Rp3 million a month as a security guard for heavy machinery located at the mining location. “Everything has grown with nickel,” she said, pointing to the houses with cars in the garages. Before the nickel mining, houses in her neighborhood had wood walls and sago palm frond roofing. Nearly no one can endure to work as fisherman in the villages located around the nickel mining location. Ratna said that the waters are contaminated with nickel slurry. Fishing platforms are often destroyed when barges in Tapunggaya Bay crash into them. As a result, fishers must search for daily catch further out at sea, making it more expensive to sail. “It is difficult to find fish now,” she said. Amirudin is one of two heads of households in RT 4 in Tapunggaya who remains to be a fisherman. He confirmed Ratna’s story. According to him, fish catches have been getting smaller since nickel mining started. Sometimes he catches 10 kilograms of fish a night, which are sold in the market for Rp200,000. “Before the nickel mining, my income was Rp600,000 a night,” he said. This is also the case in Mandiodo village. Slamet Riadi, the local village head, said that of the 239 heads of households in his area, perhaps only about 10 percent are still fishermen. Slamet explained that in addition to having difficulty catching fish, working in the factory is more promising. “It used to be easy to catch fish and difficult to sell them. Now it is easy to sell them but you have to go far out to catch them,” he said. In addition to earning wages working at the nickel smelter, residents in villages receive compensation from each company for the dust issue. In Mandiodo village, said Slamet, each family receives Rp1.5 million in compensation per month. This was an agreement reached between local communities and the company. According to him, the air became polluted after the nickel smelter went into operation, and conditions are particularly bad during the dry season. However, during the rainy season the dust dissipates but Mandiodo is inundated by mud, something which had never previously occurred in this village. In early December 2022, the entire Mandiodo village was inundated with mud mid-calf deep. According to Slamet, the mud ran down from the hills around Mandiodo that have become barren due to nickel mining. “Nickel gives life to the economy, but it destroys the environment,” he said.""

GEM (Wuxi) Energy Materials, a wholly-owned company under GEM, holds a 51% share of the project, Singapore-based CAHAYA JAYA INVESTMENT PTE.LTD holds a 26% share, and Weiming (Hong Kong) International Holdings Limited an 18% share, the company said.""

(Environmental Justice Atlas, 7/5/2022, ejatlas.org): ""The Indonesia Morowali Industrial Park (IMIP), Indonesia’s largest nickel-based industrial area, is located in the Bahodopi district of Morowali Regency, Central Sulawesi, Indonesia [1], [2]. It has an area of 3,200 hectares and is served by coal-fired power plants with over 2GW capacity as of 2021[1], [3], [4]. The IMIP was established in October 2013 as a joint venture between Shanghai Decent Investment Group (66.25%), a subsidiary of Tsingshan Group from China, and PT Bintang Delapan Group (33.75%) from Indonesia [5]–[7]. Prior to this,  Shanghai Decent and PT Bintang Delapan formed a joint venture in 2009, namely Sulawesi Mining Investment (SMI), which allegedly was already granted extraction rights to 47,040 hectares of laterite nickel ore mining land in Morowali Regency at the time when SMI was established [2], [5]. The IMIP project received financial support from policy banks in China, including China Development Bank, the Export-Import Bank of China, and state-owned Chinese banks including Bank of China, as well as international banks such as HSBC [5], [8]. The total investment in the IMIP reached USD 9.5 billion as of 2020, making it possible for the IMIP to become an industrial compound with its own production and residential facilities, including smelter plants, captive coal-fired power plants, mosques, housing facilities, as well as seaports and an airport [4]...""

IMIP Industrial Zone is a collaboration between BintangDelapan Group from Indonesia and Tsingshan Steel Group from China.
Tsingshan Group at a Glance
Before building a nickel-based industry in Morowali, Tsingshan Group had 3 nickel pig iron (NPI) production units with a capacity of 2 million tons and 3.4 million tons of Stainless Steel. Tsingshan Group is the largest company in the world in the field of nickel processing and has mastered complete processing technology with advanced and modern technology.""

(Ginting & Moore, 11/22/2021, thepeoplesmap.net):
""The Indonesia Morowali Industrial Park (IMIP) was initially built for the purpose of developing nickel pig iron and stainless-steel production, but with the rise of the electric vehicle market, the park’s focus expanded to take advantage of the emergence of nickel as a critical mineral in the renewable energy transition. Construction of the park, in Morowali Regency, Central Sulawesi, began in 2013, and it is now the largest nickel-based industrial area in Indonesia, with 11 smelters. However, this massive development has a significant ecological footprint through submarine wastewater disposal and air pollution from coal-generated power.
[IMIP] Project Impacts:
Water Pollution and Biodiversity Loss: Pollution and wastewater runoff from the park have impacted water quality, decreasing the numbers of fish and other marine life and forcing fishers to travel further out to sea. Proposed plans for deep-sea tailings disposal raised serious environmental concerns but applications were later withdrawn by the company.
Air Pollution: Emissions from the plants powering the park are increasing air pollution and causing respiratory illnesses in surrounding populations.
Deforestation: Rates of deforestation rose in the years following the Indonesian Government’s ban on resource exports and the start of construction of the IMIP in 2013.
Militarisation: The IMIP is designated a National Strategic Project (NSP), and to protect the investment, the police presence has already increased in the vicinity and an additional military presence is planned.
Labour: Workers lack labour protections and face job instability, low wages, and workplace safety hazards.
Local Community: Despite the jobs created in the park, most local people remain engaged in agriculture as they do not have the skills or desire to work in industrial projects. A decline in government investment in agricultural projects, coupled with environmental impacts from the IMIP, has caused hardship for farmers.""",Operational with Continued Construction,2015,,2013,11,0,0,1,1,1,0,"Workers' rights dispute:
3 Chinese workers file rights complaint over inhumane work conditions at IMIP

(Yuniar, 3/3/2023, scmp.com): Indonesia’s nickel sector under scrutiny as Chinese workers allege inhumane working conditions
""Indonesia’s decision to partner China to realise its ambition in growing its nickel-refining sector is under scrutiny after three Chinese workers filed a rights complaint over their alleged inhumane working conditions in the nickel-mining hub on the island of Sulawesi.
Jakarta-based AMAR Law Firm & Public Interest Law Office is representing the unnamed workers, who had “experienced a lot of suffering in physical, psychological, financial, and their dignity as human beings while working in the Indonesia Morowali Industrial Park (IMIP)”...
One of the workers put up with the poor conditions for six months before finally quitting over declining health, the law firm said in a statement.
In their complaint, workers said they suffered “respiratory problems, memory loss, rapid heartbeat, and so on, because the factory is filled with dense smoke and it is difficult to breathe”.
They said employees were also forced to work more than 12 hours a day, and had no holidays and rest days. Workers from China were not allowed to leave the IMIP compound, had their passports withheld, and had difficulty communicating with those around them due to language barriers, the report said.

(Environmental Justice Atlas, 7/5/2022, ejatlas.org): ""Labor conditions is another major issue at the IMIP that has been voiced by multiple organizations. It is perceived by local workers that the Chinese peers tend to given higher wages and some of the Chinese workers were hired illegally, which led to anti-Chinese sentiments and even conflicts from time to time [32]. There were alleged labor malpractices such as termination of contracts, long working hours, unfair wages, and restrictions due to COVID-19, as well as high incident and fatality rate [7], [32], [33]. In a most recent case, “leading activists of the United Labour and People’s Alliance, which consists of three labor unions, the Morowali Industrial Workers Union (SPIM), the Morowali Indonesian Prosperous Labour Union (SBSI), and the Morowali Indonesian National Federation of Workers’ Unions (FSPNI), were dismissed unilaterally on 14 August 2020 by the management of the company due to their union activity in the pandemic time [34].” This incident started from a series of interactions between the Alliance and the company at the beginning of the Covid-19 pandemic, where 2,000 workers were sent home or told to quarantine. On 5 August 2020, the Alliance held a demonstration in front of the IMIP office, which led to a mediation meeting between the Alliance and the IMIP coordinated by the government through the Bahodopi sub-district secretary (Sekcam). On 14 August, three union leaders joined a meeting with the management of PT Indonesia Tsingshan Stainless Steel (ITSS) and PT Bukit Smelter Indonesia (BSI), which ended up with a unilateral dismissal of the three union leaders in the name of provoking colleagues to hold demonstrations and disrupting/hindering production.

Dispute with local residents:
Local resident protests due to environmental concerns
(Environmental Justice Atlas, 7/5/2022, ejatlas.org): ""There were a number of protests and demonstrations held by local residents and student groups in response to the environmental and social concerns related to the IMIP and associated nickel mining activities. In 2019, there was a massive flood that hit the Bahodopi area. In September 2019, hundreds of residents took to the streets in Dampala Village in the Bahodopip district, about 7 kilometers away from the IMIP, as a result of the lack of satisfying response from mining companies after the flood that hit the three villages of Dampala, Le Le and Siumbatu on 8 June 2019 [28]. The flood disaster claimed the lives of two residents and hundreds of houses, as well as public facilities. Residents that are members of the Aliansi Rakyat Menggugat (Armet) claimed that the cause of the flood was related to the nickel mining activities upstream of the village, and demanded a review of the environmental impact assessment (Amdal) document of PT Bintang Delapan Mineral (BDM) and revoking the company of its mining business license (MBL) [21]. It was reported that the flood did not affect the operation of the IMIP, but cut off some workers from their workplace due to the collapse of bridges and road. The Morowali Police Chief ended up coordinating the negotiation between the protesters and the local government, who promised to compensate the local residents for their loss and evaluate the MBL holders such as BDM [18], [28]. In November and December 2021, demonstrations were held by student group Aliansi Mahasiswa dan Masyarakat Morowali (AMMM) and consumer group Aliansi Pelanggan Listrik Menggugat (Pelita) Morowali respectively to request for solving the local electricity crisis, as local residents suffered from frequent blackouts.[29] While the demonstration was more targeting the local government and electricity provider PLN, the electricity shortage at the local communities is in direct contrast with the scale of coal-fired power plants built by the IMIP that provides electricity supply to its industrial operations. In fact, the IMIP allocated most of its corporate social responsibility (CSR) budget to electricity subsidies to address the community electricity shortage in the Bahodopi district, including Fatufia, Keurea, Bahodopi and Bahomakmur villages [30]. It was reported that the construction of the CFPP at the IMIP helped with the electricity access in the area, especially with the subsidies from the company. However, PLN did not continue the collaboration with the IMIP and used diesel power instead [31].""

Environmental Impact:
Deforestation, water pollution, damage to local farms, respiratory infections
(Environmental Justice Atlas, 7/5/2022, ejatlas.org/conflict ): ""The Bahodopi district is home to 12 villages, including 4 villages most directly affected by the IMIP, namely Bahodopi, Keurea, Fatufia and Bahomakmur [9]. Local NGOs such as AEER, JATAM and Yayasan Tanah Merdeka (YTM) have been raising the issues regarding the environmental and social impact of the IMIP, including the nickel mining activities and the CFPPs [20]. An academic article also documented different forms of conflicts involving various stakeholders in the nickel mining area in and around the IMIP based on interviews and questionnaires, especially the conflicts between migrant communities and local residents, and between local residents and companies [9]. The often mentioned impacts include the degradation of forests, rivers and coastal zones in the neighborhood, the impact on local farmers’ livelihood, and the health impact on the local residents [18]. It was reported that acute respiratory infection (ARI) is a common issue for local residents, including kids, in the Bahodopi district [18], [21]. While the companies claimed that they have used electrostatic precipitators at CFPPs and kilns to collect coal ash and some companies also used nets to filter coal ash, it appeared to be ineffective according to local residents’ complaints [18].

""The recent clashes between Chinese and Indonesian workers at the PT GNI smelter factory area were not only triggered by disagreement between Indonesian and foreign workers. The clash was the accumulation of a series of government policies and regulations trying to please the industry while ignoring a myriad of corporate crimes against workers, affected communities, and the environment.
PT GNI is a Chinese company that started building a smelter and coal fired power plant in 2018 in Bunta in Central Sulawesi. The inauguration took place in Konawe in Southeast Sulawesi at an industrial park from the same owner, Tony Zhou Yuna, in presence of President Jokowi accompanied by a number of Ministers and Regional leaders on 27 December 2021.
At the inauguration, Jokowi emphasized that the local Governor and Regent should maintain ‘a conducive investment climate, so that there would be absorption of labor, foreign exchange and taxes’.
This includes keeping a strict law and order status in the area. It is not surprising that after the clashes at GNI, Jokowi’s only immediately response was instructing the National Police Chief to take firm action against the rioters. In no time, the police arrested dozens of Indonesian workers who were accused of being the perpetrators, but all officials are turning a blind eye to the problems that caused the clashes.
This shows the true character of the government and the law enforcement model of the police: it is more important to protect investments, rather than the take care of the safety of the people, protect the environment, as well as the welfare of the workers themselves.

Even before PT Gunbuster Nickel Industry (PT GNI) was inaugurated by Jokowi, the operations of this  Chinese company had caused a number of environmental and humanitarian crimes. JATAM found that the company has a bad reputation when if comes to environmental and humanitarian crimes including its arrogance towards workers...
[4] Based on information from a number of workers, 10 workers have died since PT GNI started its operations. The first victim, with the initials HR, died on June 3, 2020 after he got buried by an excavator. His body was only discovered two days after the incident.
In May and June 2022, 2 foreign workers committed suicide.  Their initials are MG and WR.
There were other heartbreaking stories. YSR was swept away by an avalanche while operating the bulldozer without lights and sank into the sea at a depth of 26 meters. AF lost his life while working in the smelter. He was found lifeless after falling next to the control board of a hydraulic machine.
NS and MD are the two victims of a smelter furnace explosion on December 22, 2022. NS was a TikTok celebrity who went viral after he regularly posted his activities as a crane operator.
On January 14, 2023, the clash at PT GNI area resulted in 3 deaths; two Indonesian worker and a Chinese worker, and several injured.
[5] Based on the statements of a number of workers, the company also cut various benefits that are workers’ rights, as well as creating and maintaining wage gaps and worker facilities between Indonesian and non-Indonesian workers, even if they do the same type of work.
For example, Chinese workers are getting salaries and additional facilities that are higher than the majority of domestic workers. This gap is also reflected in the colour of the helmets: white and red helmets for Chinese workers, and yellow helmets for the Indonesian workers. The managers are wearing white helmets, the supervisors a red one, and the yellow helmet are for the ‘crew’.
Most Chinese workers are in commanding positions and are giving orders to Indonesian workers. Few Chinese workers are speaking Indonesian, they give their instructions in Mandarin and are often not understood. This often frustrated Chinese workers, with start yelling which in their tun offends Indonesian workers. This unhealthy work atmosphere has not been dealt with for years...
The Network of Actors behind PT GNI
Tony Zhou Yuan, the director of PT GNI, also serves as director of two other nickel smelter companies in Southeast Sulawesi, namely PT Virtue Dragon Nickel Industry (VDNI) and PT Obsidian Stainless Steel (OSS).
According to JATAM’s records, PT VDNI reported and criminalized 12 workers who took action and clashed with company security officers.
Meanwhile, PT OSS reportedly polluted the air in six villages with coal dust and polluted air from the company’s coal power plants which are only hundreds of meters away from the residents’ settlements. The residents’ activities were disrupted, their eyes turned red when exposed to the pollution and often cough and have difficulty breathing.
Tony Zhou Yuan has a close relationship with Ali Mazi, the governor of Southeast Sulawesi. Ali Mazi is known to be on the supervisory board of Tony Zhou Yuan’s Foundation, the Andrew & Tony Foundation.
In JATAM’s view, the clashes between workers at PT GNI, the track record of the Chinese company, as well as the government’s response and legal approach from the security forces are a concrete example of how the interests of business people and the ruling political elite in Indonesia are strengthening.
JATAM believes that both the Indonesian and non-Indonesian workers are victims of this collusion. The government and security forces are actually framing a story in which they are scapegoating the Chinese staff, in order to avoid the unjust reality of a structural conflict.""

Land acquisition issues:
(Project Multatuli,  05/07/2023, projectmultatuli.org/): ""...Wahono has rice fields and oil palm plantations. Rice fields covering an area of ​​1 ha, oil palm plantations covering an area of ​​4 ha. Both are now no longer productive because the water never recedes.
The oil palm plantation is included in the PT GNI area. Apart from Wahono, there are around 37 ha of transmigrant land that is included in the industrial area. On average, residents have 2 ha of land. There are some who have 1 ha, there are also 6 ha.
Their land is now part of a ""national vital object"". Access for residents is difficult. The gates of PT GNI are closely guarded by security forces, from company security officers, police, to soldiers.
Residents asked for compensation, including Wahono. However, PT GNI appreciates it with a land acquisition value of IDR 15 thousand/m² or IDR 150 million/ha. In fact, in 2019, the release price was IDR 2,500/m² or IDR 25 million/ha.
Wahono objected to the price.
He set the price of his land at IDR 50 thousand/m² or IDR 500 million/ha, taking into account that PT GNI sunk his oil palm plantations. But, the company refused.
“But, their tricks are good. They drowned [the palm trees]. ""Finally, it became unproductive land,"" complained Wahono.
Wahono offered a middle way: asking PT GNI to help residents whose rice fields and gardens were sinking by converting them into ponds.
PT GNI can lend tools and fuel to raise the embankments, providing a path for fish to descend to the empang. That way, said Wahono, society also has economic movement.
However, the company ignored this proposal.
Wahono couldn't stay silent. Land as a source of livelihood for his family is a matter of life and death. And, as transmigrants, their land is limited.
Wahono tried to find another way. To get the company's attention, he closed the road in front of his house, the road used by PT GNI for motorized vehicles going in and out of the company.
However, instead of listening to residents' complaints, PT GNI sent security forces to their homes. Police and soldiers came and opened the way. Wahono couldn't move.
Finally, Wahono took the initiative to make a new excavation so that the river could flow. After complaining to the regent's office, DPRD and local police, the government lobbied PT GNI to allow Wahono to borrow tools to dig.
Wahono worked on it for two months.
And, it's proven. Since the excavation, the ground surface has become dry again.
However, after only two weeks, the river route was closed again by PT GNI.
""Because what I passed was a hauling road,"" said Wahono. ""I want to build a bridge. If they run out of water, please close. If they are excessive, open them. So that we can live together. But, no. They just closed.”
Wahono complained to the Governor of Central Sulawesi, Rusdy Mastura. Rusdy ordered his staff to go to the field.
The company's response was to raise the land surface of residential areas. The digging of a new river route was never granted. The house didn't sink anymore, but the puddle never disappeared.
Wahono's oil palm plantations and rice fields remain depleted.""

Environmental Impact:
PT. GNI/PT. Stardust Estate Investment has damed the river near Bunta Village before it reaches the river, resulting in constant flooding and ruining cropland. Unfair land acquistion practices. Pollution from captive coal plants.

(Benua, 9/2/2023, benua.id): ""...the PT Stardust Estate Investment (SEI) industrial area in North Morowali, Central Sulawesi. In this industrial area there is PT Gunbuster Nickel Industri (GNI) with an area of ​​1,907 hectares and PT Central Omega Resources (COR). Both are nickel refining smelter companies owned by Jiangsu Delong Nickel Industry Co.Ltd, investors from China which operate in Bunta Village, East Petasia District, North Morowali.
To move the smelter, GNI built a Captive Coal Steam Power Plant (PLTU) on a land area of ​​712.80 hectares. Unfortunately, the process of building and working on the PLTU dammed the Lampi River at that location without the knowledge of residents and land owners around the river. Walhi Central Sulawesi predicts that when the intensity of rain is high, the Lampi River water will definitely overflow and could submerge rice fields and residential areas of local residents.
""The air in hamlet 5 of Bunta Village is allegedly filled with sulfur dioxide gas (So2), which is a poisonous gas resulting from burning coal from the Captive Power Plant,"" said Sunardi Katili, Regional Executive Director of Walhi, Central Sulawesi during a press conference on Monday, June 12.
Not only that, the construction of a jetty in Tanauge Village, Petasia District to serve as an entry point for the mobilization of coal supplies since early 2023, is alleged to have taken 65 hectares of residents' land without any compensation process. Sunardi said that the majority of the people who work as fishermen at that location are also suffering due to the operation of the Captive PLTU.
""The massive mobilization of coal-laden barges for the needs of the Captive PLTU at that location has had a big impact on the economic and social life of fishermen around that location. ""In fact, some people have stopped fishing because coal often spills, plus strict security by the Air and Water Police has become a frightening threat for fishermen looking for fish again,"" explained Sunardi Katili.
Currently, PT. GNI has built 3 Captive coal PLTU units in Tanauge Village with a capacity of 300 MW which is only approximately 500 meters from residential areas. As a result, said Sunardi, residents around the PLTU have to clean their houses every day, close doors and windows to avoid black dust from PT's burning coal. GNI.""

(Project Multatuli,  05/07/2023, projectmultatuli.org/): ""SINCE PT Gunbuster Nickel Industry (GNI) operated a smelter factory, Wahono and his family complained that the heat of the sun was no longer friendly. At the same time, the surface of the land around his house in Bunta Village, North Morowali, never dries out.
The plants lined up in front of the stilt house looked dry and covered in dust. The PT GNI industrial area is located about 10 km from his house. Dust from the factory flies around and sticks to the plants.
Under the house on stilts, black-brown water pooled and wet household utensils. The stagnant water smells and makes you itchy, said Wahono, who lives with his wife and three children, the youngest 6 months old, and his in-laws.
PT GNI needs water as a coolant for coal power plants to meet the needs of nickel processing and refining facilities ( smelters ) in the area. The company takes water from the Koro Lamoito river—residents usually call it the Lampi River—by blocking the residents' river flow. As a result, river water overflowed into residential areas and flooded roads.
To overcome this, Wahono raised the ground surface of the house and around the house with sand and stones. The plan is that he will build a boarding house on the land next to his house.
Wahono is a transmigrant from Ponorogo, East Java, whose parents brought him in when he was 17 years old in 1996. The New Order government provided 1 ha of land for the transmigrants to work on rice fields. In total, there were 132 families from Java who took part in the transmigration program. Wahono remembers that the army was closely monitoring the process of farmers planting rice fields.
However, the Indonesian government also rolled out the red carpet for two corporations coming to North Morowali, which are slowly evicting the transmigrants' land.
The first company was the palm oil plantation PT Agro Nusa Abadi (ANA), a subsidiary of PT Astra Agro Lestari Group, which arrived in 2006. Thirteen years later it was PT GNI.
""Companies should come and bring goodness to the community,"" said Wahono.
What happened was just the opposite. Companies come to steal people's land. The company also caused environmental changes, making it impossible for residents to grow crops, residents alleged.
In the past, Wahono rice fields used to harvest twice a year. After PT ANA arrived, this company was accused of embanking the rice field planting areas, causing flooding of rice fields and residential areas. Wahono can only harvest rice once a year during the dry season.
Then, when PT GNI closed the river flow, the water overflowed even more. Both the dry season and the rainy season, the land is submerged. Wahono couldn't harvest at all.
It felt, for Wahono, like being pranked by the state. ""I also know that [investment] is between countries,"" said Wahono, referring to PT GNI. “But we are the hosts. No matter how small we are.”
'To and fro the water'
The main road in Bunta Village is the route for PT GNI workers' motorized vehicles and trucks entering and exiting the company. The road is now full of holes. Every time it rains heavily, the holes are flooded. Part of the ground surface of the house on the side of the road was also submerged in water.
In April 2023, floods submerged Bunta Village. The water almost touched the floor of the Wahono stilt house.
In 2019, shortly after PT GNI built a nickel smelter area, flooding also occurred. That year was the first time people's houses were flooded for three months. Land transportation was cut off. PT GNI workers, who go to work via the Bunta Village road, also have to use boats.
It is true that there is usually a flood every five years in Bunta Village. However, since PT GNI came to close the river, the impact of the flooding has become worse, residents said.
The flood never stopped completely. Even in summer, residential land remains flooded with water.
""We can't stand it. ""To and fro the water,"" said Wahono.
Wahono has rice fields and oil palm plantations. Rice fields covering an area of ​​1 ha, oil palm plantations covering an area of ​​4 ha. Both are now no longer productive because the water never recedes.
The oil palm plantation is included in the PT GNI area. Apart from Wahono, there are around 37 ha of transmigrant land that is included in the industrial area. On average, residents have 2 ha of land. There are some who have 1 ha, there are also 6 ha.

(Media Alkhairaat, 8/9/2022, media.alkhairaat.id): WALHI Central Sulawesi Reveals Results of Investigation of Impact of Morut Nickel Company Activities
""The Forum for the Environment (WALHI) of Central Sulawesi Province (Sulteng) conducted an investigation regarding the presence and activities of the nickel mining company PT. Stardust Estate Investment (SEI) and PT. Gun Buster Nickel Industry (GNI) in North Morowali Regency (Morut).
Chairman of the WALHI Regional Council for Central Sulawesi, Richard Labiro, said that we found facts and this has become a problematic issue in the community, especially Bunta Village, East Petasia District and Tanauge Village, Petasia District, North Morowali Regency (Morut)...
He said that the impact they found was that from an environmental perspective, the existence of a steam power plant (PLTU), residents of Hamlet 5, Bunta Village were exposed to Sulfur Dioxide (SO2) resulting from burning coal.
""And in the early morning, residents there feel fog, but it's not the usual fog like before company activities,"" he said.
Although he said, there has been no impact felt by local communities such as ISPA and others, but vulnerable groups who are threatened include mothers, the elderly and children.
Apart from that, he said, due to the company filling up the Lampi River, when it rains even a little, the Lampi River water overflows into the settlements, plantations, rice fields and livestock of the residents of V Transmigration Hamlet, Bunta Village.
“Even though the company is responsible for this. But it doesn't solve the problem. ""The company excavated land in the area to fill in flooded roads,"" he explained.
He said, regarding the incident of water overflowing into residential areas and others, local residents had reported it to the Governor of Central Sulawesi, but until now there had been no solution.
Meanwhile, the impact felt by Tanauge residents, he explained, was that compensation was not transparent and the payment was not open, there was no socialization of compensation prices to the community from the previous local government.
Apart from that, according to him, the agreement on the area for the construction of the Jetty between the company and the residents changed at the beginning when it was agreed that the area was 15 hectares, but as time went by it was suspected that the area would be more than 15 hectares.
""So the water area has been privatized by the company to build a ring road,"" he said.
Even for the activities of barges and towing barges for parking in front of residential areas, there is a price set by the company to be paid to the community, but the payment is not enjoyed by the residents, due to problems with the local village government.
""On the other hand, the local community is worried that their availability of clean water will be affected due to the expansion of the company area,"" he said.
Based on the results of the investigation carried out, he said, Walhi, as an organizer on labor issues, will strengthen residents affected by the company's activities. And will take legal action if there are indications of environmental violations.""",1,1,0,0,0,0,Nickel,,"PT. Gunbuster Nickel Industry, PT. Nadesico Nickel Industry, PT Central Omega Resources, PT.

(Adrianople Group, 6/22/2022, adrianoplegroup.com): Zone Profile: Makassar Industrial Estate
""Zone Overview‍
The Makassar Industrial Estate is a Special Economic Zone (SEZ) located on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi.
The Makassar Industrial Estate is located right outside of the city of Makassar, which is the capital of the South Sulawesi province, and has a population of 1.5 million, making it the 13th largest city in the country. [1]
The estate is publicly owned and operated. Tenants include companies in the food processing and manufacturing industries. They enjoy various tax and regulatory incentives, as well as access to transportation infrastructure.
History of the Zone
In 1988, the Indonesian government created the Makassar Industrial Estate.[2]
The estate was created at a time of rapid economic growth in Indonesia. President Suharto, who governed Indonesia from 1968 until 1998, made significant reforms to the economy. Indonesia’s GDP grew from $7 billion USD in 1968 to $84 billion USD in 1988.
In the late 1980s, the Indonesian government passed several reforms to increase exports such as devaluing the currency. Notably, in 1989, the government created SEZ-style “Industrial Estates.” Restrictions on foreign investment within the estates were relaxed. The reforms were successful.[5] The GDP per capita of Indonesia grew 550% during the 1990s, and annual GDP growth averaged at 7%.[6]
Plans for the Makassar Industrial Estate go as far back as 1975, with the growth of the business park mostly occurring in the 1990s and early 2000s. The estate started producing cacao and flour in the early 2000s.[15]
In April 2019, the Makassar New Port opened several kilometers from the estate.[2] Recently there have been plans to expand zone because most of the existing plots have already been sold out.[4]
Notable Tenants
As of 2020, there are 270 businesses operating within the industrial estate, 27 of which are Japanese companies.[2] The tenants belong to the following industries: seafood processing, cold storage, animal feed, and agricultural processing.[2]
One notable tenant is Indofood, one of Indonesia’s largest food processors. Another notable tenant is Plastindo, a large plastic packaging manufacturer.
Management of the Zone
‍The Makassar Industrial Estate is managed by Kawasan Industri Makassar (KIMA).
KIMA is a state owned enterprise which manages Makassar as well as several other industrial estates on the island of Sulawesi.[1] 60% of the company is owned by the Indonesian government, the Government of South Sulawesi owns 30% of the shares, and the remaining 10% is owned by the Makassar city government.[2] It is regulated by the Indonesian Ministry of State Owned Enterprises.[1]
Main Incentives
‍The laws that currently govern the Makassar Industrial estate are Law 39 from 2009 and Government Regulation 40 from 2021.[2][7][8][9]
Companies located in the zone can take advantage of the following incentives:
The ability to write off various investments from the corporate income tax
Accelerated depreciation and amortization of assets
A 10% tax on dividends
Streamlined import / export regulations
Easy access to business VISAs
0% interest rates on loans for land purchases
The minimum wage for tenants has been reduced from 4.4 million IDR / month ($305) to 2.9 million IDR ($200)
KIMA (the management company) will handle environmental impact assessments
‍Infrastructure
‍As of early 2020, the zone covers an area of 336 hectares, although there are plans for expansion.[2] The estate provides electricity, clean water, telecommunications, medical clinics, warehouses, and has a fire station. The estate also helps its tenants with construction by providing transportation or rental of equipment. The park is also the only industrial area in Sulawesi that has a liquid waste treatment process.[10]‍
As for location, the zone is 5 km away from the Sultan Hasanuddin International Airport, 18 km away from the Soekarno Hatta Seaport, 7.6 km away from the train station, and 1.8 km away from the main road.[2]
Corporate Social Responsibilities
‍The Makassar Industrial Estate’s management company, KIMA, has created various corporate social responsibility programs.[12] These include:
-KIMA Green, a program that seeks to reduce air pollution by planting trees and reducing tenant emissions
-Financing for local entrepreneurs
-An Educational Assistance Program
-​​A Free Rice ATM which gives ATM cards to the community that can be used to withdraw 5 liters of free rice every 2 weeks
Effects of COVID-19
For the few months of the pandemic, the estate had difficulties importing raw materials for processing. The breakdown of the global supply chain caused many tenants to be starved for inputs.[14] Consequently, KIMA suffered financially. The park’s financial performance in 2020 dropped compared to their performanced in 2018. Net profit in 2020 had shrunk by 10% compared to the previous year.[13]
Planned Expansion
‍In early 2019, the Ministry of Investment announced that they would expand the zone from 336 hectares to 1000 hectares. Existing plots were almost entirely sold out, and the estate found itself unable to accommodate new investors seeking to enter. A second location, called KIMA 2, is scheduled to be built elsewhere in the city Makassar.[11] The Makassar Industrial Estate is also working to modernize its logistics systems.
Conclusion
‍The Makassar Industrial Estate is one of Indonesia’s fastest growing SEZs, and will likely continue playing a major role in the region over the next decade.""  ",Operational with Continued Construction,,,1988,36,0,0,1,0,0,0,"Dispute with local residents:
Local activists requested investigation into waste management practices of Kawasan Industri Makassar due to pollution in nearby rivers and tributaries and the strong smell of waste.

(Kedai Berita, 5/20/23,kedai-berita.com): APH Asked to Investigate Corruption in Use of Waste Management Budget at KIMA
A number of anti-corruption activist institutions in South Sulawesi are busy asking Law Enforcement Officials (APH) to investigate the smell of corruption in waste management budget activities in the Makassar Industrial Area (KIMA).
""The problem of waste pollution in the riverbank areas there never stops and there is no solution. ""Finally, the pond farming community on the banks of the Tallo River tributary, the Parangloe River, was once again affected, their fish died, allegedly because they were exposed to industrial waste from KIMA,"" said Chairman of the Sulawesi Anti-Corruption Committee Working Body (ACC Sulawesi) Kadir Wokanubun.
""So I think it is very important that this case be investigated and brought into the realm of corruption, how exactly is waste management at KIMA, there will be a budget and it is very large, but how come there are still waste problems there which people around KIMA continue to complain about,"" Kadir added. 
He believes that if the use of the waste management budget at KIMA goes according to its intended purpose and is right on target, then there will be no pollution to the surrounding environment caused by industrial waste. At least the level of environmental pollution from industrial waste can be minimized.
""The question then is, why is the problem of environmental pollution in this area still occurring and is still occurring to this day. ""This means that there is something wrong with the waste management there, and to what extent the supporting budget for this has been used, whether it has been maximized and according to its intended purpose, or are you sure it is on target,"" explained Kadir.
He also questioned the implementation of the vision and mission by PT KIMA, which has a mission for a quality green industrial area and a vision to become a smart, modern and green area management company with the largest output.
""This is what PT KIMA must prioritize as the sole manager of the industrial area there. So basically all industrial companies in the area have tenant status. ""They rent tenants or space provided by PT KIMA and of course with supporting facilities including waste management facilities,"" said Kadir.
He asked APH to investigate more deeply the SOP for waste management managed by PT KIMA, starting from the inspection process, supervision, capacity or condition of waste storage areas, which of course should change along with the increasing activity of companies renting tenants or premises in the area.
""I think the focus should be here because it is related to the use of a very large budget which is related to the problem of environmental pollution due to the alleged impact of waste management which is still poor or not in accordance with existing regulations. ""We are waiting for APH's seriousness in investigating this case,"" Kadir stressed.
Previously, in a Hearing Meeting (RDP) discussing the issue of environmental pollution of the Tallo River tributary, Parangloe River, Parangloe Village, Tamalanrea District, Makassar which was initiated by Commission C of the Makassar City DPRD, a number of important points were revealed.
One of them, it was revealed that a number of companies in KIMA had fulfilled their obligation to pay money every month to PT. KIMA as the sole operator in the industrial area is related to waste management.
The obligations paid by a number of companies to KIMA are said to vary in value. Some make monthly deposits of IDR 4 million to IDR 5 million, depending on the volume of waste generated from the company's activities in question.
""Don't DLH or anyone else blame the companies at KIMA, don't say that PT at that time was like this and like this, the one responsible for the waste conditions at KIMA, not the businessman, he paid,"" said Chairman of Commission C of the Makassar City DPRD, Sangkala Saddiko while leading RDP discussed the issue of pollution of the Tallo River tributary, Parangloe River, Tamalanrea District, Makassar in the Makassar DPRD Banggar Room, Wednesday 17 May 2023.
“How much does PT Wahyu pay? 4-5 million?. Well, he pays, so if waste like that occurs it is not the entrepreneur's responsibility, the responsibility is PT KIMA because this has been a long-standing problem. ""So where has KIMA been responsible for the past few years?"" Sangkala Saddiko said.
He admitted that he was surprised that the Makassar City Environmental Service (DLH), which was also present at the RDP, said that it had carried out inspections and so on. However, the problem of environmental pollution around KIMA is thought to be due to industrial waste still occurring.
""If the inspection was carried out intensively then nothing like this would happen. ""I admit that the environment is our partner. I always ask if he proposes regulations like that, but the question is why it still happens like that,"" said Sangkala Saddiko.
""Remember, all the entrepreneurs there are making payments, don't accuse this PT, this PT is responsible for the waste, what is clear is that I asked Indofood, I asked Sari Roti and so on, it all comes down to KIMA, because he said PT KIMA oversees waste matters, so ""That's not the responsibility of the entrepreneur, the responsibility is the manager, in this case PT KIMA,"" explained Sangkala Saddiko.
He said that he was elected from the Biringkanaya electoral district, Tamalanrea and knows exactly the problems experienced by the community regarding waste.
""I once said to the residents, can you still stand a smell like this? ""If it was in accordance with the existing progress, it wouldn't have happened like that. If, for example, it went like that, the entrepreneur at KIMA wanted to carry out his activities well, so he paid to comply with the existing regulations. I was sent proof of their payment,"" Sangkala Saddiko said again.
He also admitted that he was a regular road user in Kapasa Raya. That night he passed by and opened his car window. The stench approached.
""That's why I asked from the Environmental Service earlier, if the waste mechanism was running, it wouldn't have happened like that and this, sir, I was a member of the DPRD for two terms and passed by there every day, last night, sir, when I opened the glass door, I came in with a bad smell. ""It's not good, what DLH said earlier, according to the mechanism, it's like that,"" explained Sangkala Saddiko.
The PT KIMA representative who was present at the RDP explained that PT. KIMA has a number of companies under it and is bound by an agreement.
When starting an agreement with the tenant, there is an attachment to the waste water quality standards required by the tenant.
""We have that,"" answered the PT KIMA representative in the RDP.
""Then related to how it is managed, from us it is 24 hour operational when it comes to temperature, PH, CO and DO every week, so we analyze all the required parameters according to the company every week a month,"" explained the PT KIMA representative.
He also explained that since 2022, PT KIMA has been required by the Ministry of the Environment to provide tools called sparing and sparing tools. And this tool has been installed at PT KIMA's waste water outlet to monitor the environment directly.
""That is an obligation that we have carried out,"" said the PT KIMA representative.
Regarding environmental performance, he admitted that he had held PROPER since 2004. Where PT KIMA achieved blue PROPER. These are the environmental performances that the party will probably carry out at this time.
""Then regarding why the waste water that reaches the Tallo River tributary is black, actually if you look at our environmental documents, our documents were actually written from the start. ""Our responsibility extends to the water bodies before the Tallo River tributaries,"" explained the PT KIMA representative.
""However, looking at the current fact that along the canal created by KIMA, the community and all entrepreneurs outside KIMA have connected it, so in 2018 at the Ministry of the Environment we revised the document, the ministry issued that it could no longer be charged by PT KIMA related responsibility along the canal,"" continued the PT KIMA representative.
""Why, because along the canal there are many connections from terminals, from markets and all MSME businesses, entrepreneurs and all kinds of things are all there. ""So the responsibility for environmental control is transferred to us, so we can only reach the beach point at the Sector Police,"" added the PT KIMA representative.
He admitted that the problem now is because everything is connected. In the past, he continued, when the wall was still intact and then it was broken into by the Head of the Daya Village, he also asked a Makasaar City Government official who at that time was known as Manai Sofyan.
""I asked why the wall was broken into, it would be polluted by the community, he said where else would the community's water go if it didn't come this way. ""So that's the reason, I still remember that time I went down to the field and we saw that our channels were already connected,"" emphasized the PT KIMA representative.
Tallo River Tributary Pollution Complaint
The Makassar City Environmental Service (DLH) discovered several facts about alleged environmental pollution that occurred in the Parangloe River, a tributary of the Tallo River, Parangloe Village, Tamalanrea District.
First, there was foam in the Parangloe River, then there were dead fish and shrimp in residents' ponds which were approximately 50 meters from the river location in question.
The facts found in the field were based on documentary evidence in the form of videos and photos reported by a resident of Bontoa village, Parangloe Village, Tamalanrea District regarding the presence of foam on the surface of water bodies that spread across the Parangloe River.
""Now after discovering this fact, the team carried out a cross-check in the field with the aim of identifying and collecting data as material for further analysis,"" said Acting Head of DLH Makassar City, Ferdi, Monday 15 May 2023.
Then Ferdi revealed that reports of water pollution in the Parangloe River, which he admitted was thought to be the result of industrial activities, had been discovered the previous year by the monitoring team.
""So this data and verification will be a complement or support for follow-up material,"" he explained.
Then there are several companies that operate from downstream points to the West Ring Road along the Parangloe River, namely PT. KTC, PT MT, PT BFM, PT FKS MA.tbk, PT CPI (RPHU).
""There are still several other companies that have not been identified,"" he explained.
However, based on the results of interviews with people around the location, information was obtained that there were five residential drainage channels that flowed down to the Parangloe River.
""This has not been identified because the weather at that time was rainy,"" he said.
Meanwhile, the location of the drainage channel for the residents of Bontoa Village is the Komunai Waste Water Disposal Installation (IPAL) which was built by the Makassar City Public Works Department in 2019.
""According to the local RW, the IPAL is no longer used because there is a blockage in the channel so that residents' septic tank waste water automatically flows into the drainage and then into the river,"" he said.
Not only that, some of the houses of Bontoa Village residents cross the banks of the Parangloe River, so it is estimated that domestic wastewater is directly discharged into the river.
""There is a narrowing of the width of the Parangloe river at coordinates 5° 5'47.93″S
119°28'21.60""E so that the river water does not flow smoothly and there is a buildup of sediment which causes a smell and black water,"" he explained.
However, based on the results of field parameter tests, it was revealed that the Parangloe River is a tributary of the Tallo River which is located in two sub-districts, namely Tamalanrea and Biringkanaya.
The activities along the Parangloe River are residential, industrial and pond activities. So these activities affect the carrying capacity and water quality of the Parangloe River.
It could even be fatal if the population increases and industrial activities along the Parangloe River affect the environmental conditions of the Parangloe River.
""Domestic wastewater discharge originating from residential areas and industry that is not managed properly will cause sedimentation and river water quality. ""This can be seen physically in the condition of the Parangloe River water,"" he explained.
Apart from residents' domestic wastewater, industrial and pond activities also contribute to the water quality of the Parangloe River. Moreover, industries that do not treat their wastewater properly will cause public unrest.
Ferdi explained that the appearance of floating or foamy foam could also be concluded from natural factors, namely the natural cycle of rain falling from the sky or the discharge of waste water all at once.
""To find out this, integrated monitoring is carried out involving environmental monitoring functions,"" he added. (Tamrin/Eka)

Environmental Impact:
Suspected improper waste management, polluting local rivers

(Kedai Berita, 5/20/23,kedai-berita.com) : APH Asked to Investigate Corruption in Use of Waste Management Budget at KIMA
A number of anti-corruption activist institutions in South Sulawesi are busy asking Law Enforcement Officials (APH) to investigate the smell of corruption in waste management budget activities in the Makassar Industrial Area (KIMA).
""The problem of waste pollution in the riverbank areas there never stops and there is no solution. ""Finally, the pond farming community on the banks of the Tallo River tributary, the Parangloe River, was once again affected, their fish died, allegedly because they were exposed to industrial waste from KIMA,"" said Chairman of the Sulawesi Anti-Corruption Committee Working Body (ACC Sulawesi) Kadir Wokanubun.
""So I think it is very important that this case be investigated and brought into the realm of corruption, how exactly is waste management at KIMA, there will be a budget and it is very large, but how come there are still waste problems there which people around KIMA continue to complain about,"" Kadir added. 
He believes that if the use of the waste management budget at KIMA goes according to its intended purpose and is right on target, then there will be no pollution to the surrounding environment caused by industrial waste. At least the level of environmental pollution from industrial waste can be minimized.
""The question then is, why is the problem of environmental pollution in this area still occurring and is still occurring to this day.

""Management of West Sumatra (Sumbar) government capital participation in PT. Andalas Rekasindo Pratama (ARP) was assessed by the Indonesian BPK as disorderly. This puts the provincial government at risk of losing 108 hectares of land assets and not receiving dividends. PT ARP in its journey later developed into PT. PIP.
This is a record of problems in the financial management of the West Sumatra government which were assessed by the Republic of Indonesia's BPK regarding the 2022 West Sumatra regional government financial report (LKPD).
Member V of BPK RI, Ahmad Noor Supit, said that the 108 hectare land was an asset invested by the Provincial Government.
""This asset is at risk of being lost and the West Sumatra Government is also at risk of not receiving a contribution to income in the form of dividends and income from the process of changing management rights (HPL) to building use rights (HGB) from land sales by PT. Padang Industrial Park (PIP),"" said Ahmad in Padang while attending the plenary meeting for the handover of the LHP BPK at the West Sumatra DPRD, Friday (19/5).
Ahmad added that in accordance with article 20 of Law Number 15 of 2004 concerning Audits of Management and Responsibility of State Finances, it is mandated that officials are obliged to follow up on recommendations from audit reports.
In addition, officials are required to provide answers or explanations to the BPK regarding follow-up actions to recommendations from audit reports.
""The answer or explanation referred to is submitted to the BPK no later than 60 days after the audit report is received,"" he said.
Based on monitoring data on follow-up recommendations from BPK audit results, up to the 2022 Semester II Monitoring Report, the West Sumatra Provincial Government has followed up on 1,477 recommendations out of 2,066 recommendations or 71.49 percent of the total recommendations for the 2005 - 2022 period. Thus there are still 587 recommendations ( 28.41 percent) which must be a priority for immediate action, and 2 recommendations (0.10 percent) which cannot be followed up.
""I hope that the DPRD leadership and members can participate in monitoring the completion of the follow-up to the recommendations from the examination results contained in this LHP in accordance with their authority,"" explained Ahmad.
For your information, initially the West Sumatra Provincial Government together with other parties established PT Andalas Rekasindo Pratama (ARP).
In establishing the company, the West Sumatra provincial government deposited land assets of 108 hectares with a share composition of 55 percent.
Then along the way, a joint venture was carried out with a company from Johor Malaysia which gave birth to PT. Padang Industrial Park (PIP).
In 2014 the West Sumatra DPRD formed a special committee to settle West Sumatra assets in PIP. The special committee's recommendation asks the provincial government to encourage the implementation of an extraordinary GMS to determine the status of the provincial government's capital participation in PT. ARP. However, until now the provincial government has not followed up on the recommendations.
There were several recommendations made at that time. Among them, ensuring provincial government assets are in PIP. Apart from the number of provincial government shares there and also the amount of land.
Then there is also a recommendation to seek certainty and truth regarding the capital participation from TPM Technopark SDN BHD amounting to USD 3,300,000. The DPRD believes it is necessary to find out what the funds were used for.
The DPRD also asked the provincial government to carry out an inventory of 108 hectares of land as capital investment for PT. ARP at PT. PIP which is also an equalization of the capital of the West Sumatra Provincial Government in PT. ARP.
Then he was also asked to carry out an inventory of 35.5 hectares of land which was purchased from TPM Technopark SDN BHD capital investment funds. Due to the purchase of this amount of land, the provincial government was asked to carry out a financial audit of PT. PIP.""

(Vice, 4/11/2023, vice.com): ‘They Will Die’: Tesla-Linked Mining Project Is Devastating One of the World’s Uncontacted Peoples
""Kumbang’s family are members of one of the world’s few remaining nomadic tribes living in voluntary isolation. For centuries, the O Hongana Manyawa tribe, one of these last indigenous groups, have roamed the forests of Indonesia's remote Halmahera island in small family bands tied closely to rivers in the island’s interior.
But today Kumbang’s family and their indigenous culture face an existential threat—one fueled by an industry widely touted for its green credentials, and often heralded as a panacea to the growing climate crisis. 
Where there was once vast rainforest, today an expanding massive nickel mining venture is clearing the homeland of O Hongana Manyawa, as suppliers in Indonesia race to fulfill a growing global demand for batteries powering the electric vehicle industry.
Kumbang no longer lives with his family in the rainforest, but he fears for their future as he watches the rainforest shrink around them. Their staple foods of carb-rich sago palm fruits have been razed and rivers providing drinking water poisoned by mining run-off; the rattan fibers used for clothing have become harder to find, while resin-producing trees, the sap from which is used for torches, have been obliterated. Mining encampments filled with thousands of men and security forces now occupy the hunting grounds where O Hongana Manyawa once chased deer and wild pigs for food.
“The forest is everything, it is their heart and life,” said Kumbang. The young man’s name has been changed to protect his identity due to what NGOs and activists say are credible threats to his safety for speaking out about the issue. “My parents and siblings are in the forest and without support they will die.”
Environmental groups and indigenous rights activists have sounded the alarm in recent days. They allege that mining company Weda Bay Nickel and other similar projects are destroying the traditional lands of the O Hongana Manyawa, also known as the Forest Tobelo, and are at risk of devastating their forest-dependent way of life. 
The mining projects form part of Indonesia’s emerging electric vehicle battery supply chain, into which major electric vehicle firm Tesla has reportedly invested $5 billion so far, while partnering with several companies connected to Weda Bay in the past year. 
In the last few months, two leading French and German firms have also announced they’re on the verge of pouring billions more into electric vehicle battery production sourced from Weda Bay Nickel, touting its compliance with the “highest international environmental, social and governance standards.” This includes the Initiative for Responsible Mining Assurance standards, which requires Free, Prior and Informed Consent (FPIC) from indigenous peoples affected by the project.
But rather than securing the consent of O Hongana Manyawa, Weda Bay Nickel has ravaged their lands and livelihoods, Kumbang and indigenous activist groups say.
“I will never give consent for the company to use our lands,” Kumbang said.
Hongana Manyawa number around 3,000 people across Halmahera, the largest island in eastern Indonesia’s Northern Maluku province. Many of them, like Kumbang, who is now a Christian, were born in the forest and later adopted via missionary-led interventions or resettled through government policies to integrate O Hongana Manyawa into Indonesian society in recent decades. Many still retain ties to the forest and Kumbang says he visits his parents regularly.
Between 300 and 500 members of O Hongana Manyawa, like Kumbang’s family and relatives, are still considered “uncontacted"" because they remain in voluntary isolation in the forests of Halmahera, says Sophie Grig, senior researcher for the indigenous rights nonprofit Survival International. The unsettled members of the tribe hunt and tend to bamboo gardens throughout the forest, limiting their interactions with outsiders.
“They rely on the forest for everything that enables them to live and survive and thrive,” Grig told VICE World News. Without the forest, “they won’t be able to sustain themselves.”
Yet the outside world is forcing itself upon O Hongana Manyawa.
Weda Bay Nickel’s approximately 45,000 hectare concession was awarded in 1998 by Indonesia’s then military dictator Suharto. After Weda Bay Nickel’s operations stalled for several years due to a nickel market downturn, the project resumed with renewed intensity after Chinese conglomerate Tsingshan Holding Group came on board with a controlling stake through a subsidiary in 2017. As the mining has reached further into the forests of Halmahera, riverways have been filled in with ore to form roads penetrating into the tribe’s territory, cutting off O Hongana Manyawa from drinking water, says Kumbang, who still regularly travels into the forest to visit his family. 
Even when the government later expanded forest protections in 1999, Weda Bay’s concession was carved out by presidential decree in 2004 to allow for tens of thousands of hectares of deforestation from open pit mining. Weda Bay Nickel has since contributed to the more than 47,000 hectares of the estimated 724,000 hectares of natural forest in Central and Eastern Halmahera cleared between 2017 and 2021, according to data from Forest Watch Indonesia and local environmental journalist Christ Belseran. Much more is expected in the coming years as the nickel mining projects expand to meet global demand.
Annas Rasyid, an activist with the Indonesian Indigenous People’s Alliance (AMAN), says that O Hongana Manyawa’s sustainable way of life is under threat from decades-long government policies to “civilize” them, forcing families to live in sweltering and cramped tin roofed permanent homes. Some nomadic O Hongana Manyawa have become dependent on company handouts like instant noodles and rice, while members of the tribe have also become scapegoats for authorities—tortured and imprisoned for crimes they likely did not commit and cleared off their land as a result, he added. 
When the government grants a mining concession there is never consultation with local people, because authorities do not consider them as owners of the land under Indonesian law, Rasyid says. 
""In their perspective, the land belongs to the government,” he explained, adding that Indonesian lawmakers, many with financial links to companies using indigenous lands, have refused to pass legislation that would provide stronger legal rights for indigenous peoples.
Indonesia is the world’s leading nickel producer, and has welcomed foreign investment by courting manufacturers like Tesla to grow its electric vehicle battery production. However, the industry’s development ignores any meaningful recognition of indigenous peoples, says Novenia Ambeua. She’s Chair of the activist group North Maluku Region Indigenous Peoples Alliance of the Archipelago, and a member of the Tobelo, a coastal indigenous group with close connections to O Hongana Manyawa, whose community’s territory has also been impacted by Weda Bay Nickel.
“These are the forests which we guard for the future generation and now they are being destroyed for electric cars, where is the heart of people in the west?” Ambeua told VICE World News. “This is making everything worse.”

“These are the forests which we guard for the future generation and now they are being destroyed for electric cars, where is the heart of people in the west?” Ambeua told VICE World News. “This is making everything worse.”
Weda Bay’s mining kicked off in 2019 and plans to extract 40,000 tons of nickel every year for the next four decades. 
Tesla, the world’s second biggest electric car manufacturer, signed deals in July 2022 to source processed nickel from two Chinese suppliers, which in turn get nickel from the Chinese conglomerate Tsingshan Holding Group and are both shareholders of the Weda Bay industrial park. 
Tesla CEO Elon Musk has boasted of selling 20 million electric vehicles in 2030, but his company’s promise to shareholders of ethically sourced nickel is “just an empty message,” said  Indonesia’s Mining Advocacy Network (JATAM) in a 2022 report. Despite clear evidence that suppliers like Tsingshan were carrying out destructive actions against indigenous peoples and local communities, this didn’t stop Tesla from signing deals with them, the report highlights.
""Tesla must know that the electric vehicle battery supply chain has negative social impacts on Indonesian citizens,” JATAM director Melky Nahar told VICE World News. “So if Tesla buys nickel from companies in Central Halmahera, indirectly Tesla is involved in these impacts.”
Further foreign investment into the area’s electric vehicle battery industry has just been finalized and more is expected in the coming months. Australian firm Thiess announced last month an $87 million ore-hauling contract for Weda Bay Nickel, declaring it looked forward to “building strong relationships with the local community.” In January, Bloomberg reported that German chemical giant BASF is also finalizing a multi-billion dollar deal with Weda Bay Nickel’s Eramet to develop a smelter for nickel coming from the tribe's forest lands. BASF told VICE World News that it “has not yet decided whether such a project will be implemented.” Activists say this project would also directly threaten the lives of O Hongana Manyawa and their neighbors. 
Survival International and other indigenous rights groups say that despite claims that these projects are in compliance with international standards, nickel produced by Weda Bay is in violation of widely recognized UN and World Bank requirements for FPIC agreements from indigenous peoples.
Weda Bay previously received $207 million in World Bank guarantees for its investment, legally requiring FPIC, though a World Bank audit following a complaint dismissed these concerns in 2011 and urged the company to continue dialogue with affected communities. Many of the surrounding coastal indigenous communities ultimately signed agreements under pressure and threat from police and local authorities, accepting extremely low prices for their lands. But O Hongana Manyawa living in the forests never agreed to cede their lands to the company, Kumbang says. 
Weda Bay Nickel knows that its mining concession overlaps with the territory of nomadic, isolated groups from O Hongana Manyawa who reject mining on their lands, according to an internal company report obtained by VICE World News. 
The 2013 report, funded by Weda Bay Nickel and prepared by the U.S.-based firm Cross-Cultural Consulting Services, found evidence of multiple groups of O Hongana Manyawa living inside the mining concession. The consulting firm verified the report’s existence but told VICE World News it no longer works with Weda Bay Nickel. 
O Hongana Manyawa “do not like to interact with outsiders” and it would be “unethical” to seek to contact them, the report notes. “The critical issue… is how to apply FPIC when a good proportion of the indigenous population does not want to be contacted.”
Given that the company has been mining since 2019, any claims of securing “prior” consent are a charade, Grig points out.
“They cannot possibly have had free, prior and informed consent because these people are uncontacted,” Grig said. “How could you possibly get FPIC from an uncontacted tribe?”
Tesla’s indigenous rights policy requires free and informed consent from its suppliers.
Tesla, Weda Bay, and all other companies named did not respond to repeated requests for comment from VICE World News. Survival International has called on Tesla to publicly commit to not sourcing nickel from any suppliers mining on O Hongana Manyawa’s lands. 
Weda Bay says it will respect indigenous ways of life, but the mine’s destruction has already violated the site of Kumbang’s own birth, he says, where his umbilical cord is buried beneath an ngofa ngoe sapling. In O Hongana Manyawa language, the name means “tree with many children,” and its growth was supposed to symbolize Kumbang’s own future family. 
But the last time Kumbang returned to the area in September, his birth grove had been bulldozed to muddy, red earth for Weda Bay’s mining operations.
“It broke my heart,” Kumbang said. “Everything in the forest is getting destroyed now—the river, the animals, it is all gone.”""

(Mongabay, 3/8/23, mongabay.co.id): Stories of Tobelo Indigenous Women Fighting When Damaged Forest Turns into a Mine
""""-The Tobelo Dalam indigenous women and those living in coastal villages protested the destruction of the customary forest to make way for a nickel mine and various supporting facilities. Like last October, indigenous people, including women, blocked heavy equipment operations.
-Novenia Ambeua,  an indigenous woman of Tobelo descent on the South Wasile coast , said that for the Tobelo people, the forest is home and sacred . If the forest is damaged, everything in it will also be damaged. Forests provide everything, from food such as hunting, medicine to sources of livelihood, including looking for resin.  Indigenous people's gardens are also in the forest.
-The community rejects PT IWIP's expansion into Akejira Mein's  ( Aruku Ma Ngairi ) Indigenous Forest . They also demanded that the company stop paying compensation or compassion to other parties suspected of acting on behalf of the land owner.  
-Achmad Zakih , Secretary of the North Maluku Forestry Service, dismissed the threat of forests in Central Halmahera. However, he said that it is necessary to strengthen the existence of indigenous peoples who have lived and lived in the forest for generations through a stipulation through regional regulations.""""
While recognizing that it was unethical, the report nevertheless made preparations for how to gradually approach and gain consent of groups which remained in voluntary isolation. 
“It came down to the fact that this [mining project] was going to happen,” Chris Duncan, the lead researcher hired by Weda Bay to produce its 2013 report and an anthropologist who has been studying O Hongana Manyawa since the 1990s, told VICE World News. Duncan said the logic was: “Let's try to make it better, as opposed to just opposing it. In the end we failed—we didn't get FPIC, which was the goal.” 
“These people [O Hongana Manyawa] have been screwed for decades and they will continue to get screwed,” he said.
The company has “good relations” with O Hongana Manyawa and identified 22 of the tribe’s cultural heritage sites inside its concession while implementing FPIC principles, an IWIP representative said in a 2019 statement, citing the same 2013 plan which had “failed” according to its lead researcher. 
The day after VICE World News emailed Eramet CEO Christel Bories, the company posted two statements on its website. Eramet said it had launched a “currently ongoing” study in 2023 with a local anthropologist to research the impact of the mine and “ensure we understand and respect the way of life” of O Hongana Manyawa.
“In the event that indigenous peoples may be affected by our activities, further dialogue is required, leading to the consent of these communities to the company's operations,” Eramet said in another statement posted on April 7, adding the company committed to being “audited” to show compliance with international standards.
The company also said there are no O Hongana Manyawa in coastal areas and that its planned project with BASF would not directly impact them. But O Hongana Manyawa do not live on the coast, they live in the interior forest, and the smelter would source nickel from that area, indigenous activist groups say.
Eramet did not respond directly to VICE World News’ requests for comment.
Kumbang said he has been approached multiple times in the past few years by Weda Bay Nickel and its hired anthropologist to retroactively gain consent for mining operations on his relatives’ land. Kumbang repeatedly refused. The anthropologist did not respond to requests for comment from VICE World News. 

(Environmental Justice Atlas, 1/31/2023, ejatlas.org): """"The IWIP and the associated nickel mining and processing activities have significant impacts on the environment, biodiversity, and the indigenous communities in the area [8]–[10]. Back in 2010, Indonesian community and advocacy groups JATAM (Mining Advocacy Network), WALHI, KIARA, and KAU formed an international coalition to oppose the project and the World Bank’s support of WBN [11]. The groups filed a complaint with the Compliance Advisor Ombudsman (CAO) of the World Bank [11]. Earlier studies indicated that there were significant barriers to access meaningful redress for communities that are remote in the area [2].
Over the years, the Indonesian government has been trying to resettle the indigenous group in the region outside the forest and force them to adopt conventional settled lifestyles instead of their traditional nomadic lifestyle. These people, called the O Hongana Manyawa (also referred to as Tobelo Dalam, which allegedly was against the wishes of the people themselves [11]) and means “forest people” in their indigenous language. They are one of the five last remaining nomadic Indigenous Peoples in Indonesia and categorized as endangered [3], [12] according to Aliansi Masyarakat Adat Nusantara (Indigenous Peoples Alliance of the Archipelago, AMAN), the main representative organization for Indonesia’s indigenous peoples. According to an interview with Tupa, one of the members of the six remaining tribes that are still practicing the traditional nomadic lifestyle in the forest, “Trees are gone and replaced with the big road, where giant machines go in and out making noise and driving the animals away” [3]. For the few last remaining tribe members in the forest, the forest is not only a place to inhabitat and find sources of food, it is “also a home and ‘the bridge’ that connects them with the spiritual world” [3]. It was also reported that a local resident of Lelilef Sawai Village indicated that she and other mothers were prohibited from fishing in Tanjung Uli, Karkar, and Cacu and from taking firewood [9]. The reclamation of nickel ore storage areas by PT IWIP in the Karkar area also affected local fishing activities that used to take place in the same area [9].
According to the fieldwork and report of Indonesian NGO AEER, the villagers of Lelilef Sawai, Lelilef Waibulan, and Gemaf complained about respiratory problems due to air pollution from the captive coal-fired power plants that use low calorie coal with a calorie content of only 4,200 kcal/kg [9]. Local residents also had restricted access to clean water, with the 3km Ake Sake River dammed and diverted for the construction of one of the IWIP smelters and other rivers such as Seslewe Sini and Kobe polluted [9]. AEER indicated that the increase of logging and the damming and diversion of the Ake Sake River has led to deforestation and reduced water absorption capacity and contributed to the flood that took place in August 2020 which inundated the villages and roads, including the IWIP area [9].
During the inaugural ceremony of the IWIP project in 2018, IWIP claimed that they had obtained community consent and that Akejira nomads, which Tupa belongs to, had agreed to the nickel mining activity in Central Halmahera [3]. This was questioned by Munadi Kilkoda, the regional chief of AMAN Malut (North Maluku) [13]. Some local residents had no other choice but to sell land to the company and the bid price from the companies was  low (e.g. IDR 8,000-9,000 per sq metre, equal to around half a euro) based on regional regulations [9]. While the majority of residents have sold their land, a few have refused to do so. It was reported that “intimidation by security forces, and dispossession of access to forest and other social and environmental concerns have sparked protest and denunciations of the projects” [11]. Some protests took place in 2019 by the relatives of O Hongana Manyawa band that live in Akejira forest [3]. Another protest took place in July 2020, when 450 South Wasile residents walked for two days to Kao Rahai, where PT WBN was opening a new nickel mining area, and blockaded roads by building tents and halting mining activities [9].
In addition, there were protests from students and civil society organizations in Ternate. AMAN urged IWIP to 1) comply with international laws and treaties including ILO Convention 169 and the UN Declaration on the rights of the indigenous peoples; 2) implement free, prior, informed consent (FPIC) on all forms of policies before operations that affect the livelihood of indigenous peoples; and 3) comply with Indonesian law, especially the Constitutional Court Decision Number 35/PUU-X/2012 regarding customary forests (not state forests) [3]. Students protested in Ternate and in Tobelo, North Halmahera, including the Student Action Solidarity for the Indonesian People (Samurai) Malut and the Sylfa Student Association of Kharun University [5], [14], [15]. The latter held a protest with the theme “Save Ake Jira, the Heart of Halmahera and the Tobelo Dalam Tribe”. The students demanded that the Halteng Regency Government ratify a local regulation on indigenous peoples in order to protect this tribe [5],[3]. IWIP representative responded [16] that they had obtained a borrow-to-use forest area permit (IPPKH) and that the Tobelo Dalam community is one of the main stakeholders in their mining concession, with whom they had developed a good relationship [5]. On the other hand, the issue of Ake Jira’s customary forest reached the Presidential Secretariat Office (KSP) in Jakarta with a letter sent by AMAN Malut that complained about the issues faced by the indigenous people of Tobelo Dalam in Central Halmahera after the arrival of WBN and IWIP in the area [16]. KSP issued a letter that urged the companies to respect and protect the indigenous people of Tobelo Dalam and align with the recommendations put forward by AMAN [16].
On 23 October 2019, another demonstration was held by Aliansi Masyarakat Ake Jira Halmahera (the Ake Jira Halmahera Community Alliance, AMARAH) in front of the Ternate Mayor’s office [17]. The crowd carried banners reading """" Selamatkan Ake Jira” (“Save Ake Jira”) and asked for the revocation of the Mining Business Permit (IUP) of IWIP, WBN and PT Tekindo Energy [17]. The AMARAH alliance is a coalition of NGOs, civic organizations, movements, and student associations, including Walhi Malut, AMAN Malut, LBH Marimoi, Daurmala, FNKSD, Sekolah Critis, GeMPAR, SAMURAI, LMND, GAMHAS, The Buas, PANDECTA, KAMMI IAIN, Jendela Mahasiswa Politik, Pusmat, Gemah IAIN, Jejak Timur, SEMUT, DEMA Ekonomi IAIN, and Gerilya Institut [17]. A representative of the demonstrators indicated that the mining activities in the Ake Jira forest not only threatens the Tobelo Dalam, but also has an impact on the waterbody in the region [17]. It was also indicated that the residents of Tobelo Dalam that lived in Ake Jira had left their original residential area due to massive mining activities, while AMARAH representative did not know where they had left for at the moment [14], [17].""""""

""Compensation for land acquisition owned by residents by the mining company PT Emerald Ferrochromium Industry (EFI) seems inhumane.
This was conveyed by the Coordinator of the North Maluku (Malut) Mining Advocacy Consortium (KATAM) Muhlis Ibrahim, via a press release received by Penamalut.com , Wednesday (18/8). Muhlis said that the company that carries out mining activities in North Kao District, North Halmahera, pays various residents' land.
""From the results of our investigation, some cost Rp. 3,500 to Rp. 10,000 per meter. This is of course important to reconsider, because the price is too low, “he said.
He added that the people's land is land for farming. This means that people's livelihood from agricultural produce does not match the price set by PT EFI. Moreover, the family life of the farming residents is very dependent on the land.
""Therefore, the paradigm that must be built in carrying out land acquisition for residents is not to compensate for land losses, but to compensate for profits,"" said Muhlis.
The local government, Muhlis emphasized again, must be really clear about this. Do not issue policies that actually harm society. Moreover, in the momentum of land acquisition for residents, many parties want to make a profit.

Dispute with Indonesian government: 
Potential corruption regarding bribing a judge during a lawsuit over land acquisition practicies
(Kalesang Membaca Realitas, 5/19/2023, kalesang.id): KPK Dismantles PT. Land Bribery Case. EFI in North Halmahera, North Maluku
Assistant Supreme Court Judge Receives Money from the Chairman of the Tobelo District Court
""The Corruption Eradication Commission (KPK) has again uncovered an alleged bribery case before the Supreme Court (MA). One of them is in the case of land in North Halmahera Regency, North Maluku.
The land case in North Halmahera involved the assistant supreme judge, Preastio Nugroho. Where, he allegedly received IDR 725 million from the Chairman of the Tobelo District Court (PN), I Gusti Ngurah Putu Rama Wijaya.
""(Prasetio Nugroho) received IDR 725 million."" That's what the Corruption Eradication Commission (KPK) charges, as quoted by detikcom, kalesang.id, Friday (19/5/2023).
The handover of money worth IDR 725 million was received by Preastio Nugroho at Rest Area KM 19 of the Jakarta-Cikampek Toll Road, South Tambun District, Bekasi Regency on February 18 2022.
The money came from PT Emerald Ferochromium Industry (PT.EFI) as respondent I, in civil cassation case Number 542 K/Pdt/2022 regarding the dispute between applicant Marjon Ahiki and the mining company PT Emerald Ferochromium Industry which currently operates in Kao District , North Halmahra
The IDR 725 million, as the prosecutor said, was then received by 3 people, including Prasetio Nugroho, IDR 85 million, Supreme Court staff Redhy Novariasza IDR 60 million, and the remainder was received by Supreme Court PNA Muhajir Habibie.
In a copy of the cassation file quoted by detikcom, the dispute was initially heard at the Tobelo District Court, North Halmahera. Where, Marjon Ahiki fought PT. EFI, North Halmahera Regency Government and Pricing Team.
Marjon Ahiki asked the Supreme Court to decide that the price determination by the Forkopimda Pricing Team of the North Halmahera Regency Government must be canceled by law.
Then, stating the results of land measurements by PT company officers. EFI is legally flawed and must be canceled by law.
Marjon asked for compensation for the price of land per meter in Gulo Village worth IDR 150 thousand/meter. Then, on November 24 2021, the Tobelo District Court did not accept Marjon Ahiki's application.
This is the reason why Marjon Ahiki filed an appeal to have his lawsuit granted. As a result, the Supreme Court also rejected Marjon Ahiki's appeal on February 21 2022.
After investigating, 3 days before the decision there was a flow of funds from the Chairman of the Tobelo District Court. Even so, the Corruption Eradication Commission (KPK) in its indictment did not say whether the funds reached the cassation panel.

(Riyandanu, 5/5/2023, katadata.co.id): PTBA Claims Realization of Special Industrial Area to Attract Downstream Investors
""PT Bukit Asam Tbk (Persero) or PTBA submitted a proposal to the government to follow up on the development of a special industrial area in Tanjung Enim, South Sumatra. This step is aimed at attracting investors for coal gasification projects into Dimethyl Ether (DME).
The gasification project is estimated to be able to produce 1.4 million tons of DME per year from 6 million tons of 4,200 calorie coal. However, this project stalled after the gas and chemical processing company from the United States (US), Air Products and Chemicals Inc, withdrew as the primary investor. The project worth IDR 34.04 trillion will also produce 2.1 million tons of methanol per year and Syngas or synthetic gas of 4.5 million kN/m3 per year. ""We propose that the Tanjung Enim Industrial Area be designated as a KEK in order to obtain incentives for investors who contribute to the development of coal downstreaming,"" said PTBA Corporate Secretary , Apollonius Andwie, via short message on Friday (5/5).
The KEK in question is an integrated industrial area covering an area of ​​585 hectares in Tanjung Enim. The area, named 'Bukit Asam Coal-Based Industrial Estate', is projected to become a center for downstream and energy-based industries.
It is hoped that the establishment of a special economic zone will attract investor capital by offering incentives provided by the government. The special land is intended for the development of downstream industries in collaboration with potential partners. In addition, PTBA has allocated special coal reserves for downstream projects, so that coal needs for the downstream industry can be guaranteed. ""With strong support from the government, PTBA is optimistic that coal downstreaming will be realized,"" said Apollo.
Minister of Energy and Mineral Resources Arifin Tasrif revealed that Air Products and Chemicals Inc. withdrew from two coal downstream projects with PT Bukit Asam due to the change in the company's business direction to become a hydrogen developer in its home country, the United States (US). Air Products' maneuver was also motivated by the US Government's policy of supporting the development of new and renewable energy (EBT) by providing subsidies to projects being carried out, especially hydrogen development.
""Because the US is encouraging the use of hydrogen, they feel that business in the US is more attractive. In the US there are subsidies for EBT, there are more interesting projects for hydrogen,"" said Arifin when met at the Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources office on Friday (17/3). This is regulated in the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) or the Inflation Reduction Act which was issued in August 2022. Through the IRA, the US government disbursed US$ 369 billion to maintain national energy security while reducing the impact of climate change. The IRA also arranges easy investment credit for the development of hydrogen storage projects and technologies. ""This is what causes many investors to flee to the US,"" said Arifin.""

(Arief, 11/28/2022, merdeka.com): ""President Director of PT Bukit Asam Tbk Arsal Ismail said his party is still waiting for a Presidential Regulation (Perpres) which is still in the drafting stage, for the coal gasification project to Dimethyl Ether (DME). This downstream project is targeted to be completed in 2027.
This project is handled by 3 companies, namely PTBA as a coal supplier, PT Pertamina as an offtaker, and a company from the United States Air Products as a processing and technology provider.
""Now, the most important point for us is the regulation. Until now, the draft presidential regulation has been discussed by the relevant ministries and this is one of the necessary conditions that we must fulfill so that this project can accelerate the DME,"" said Arsal in the Commission VII DPR RI Hearing Meeting with PTBA, Monday (28/11).
This Presidential Decree is one of the 6 points of coal gasification progress. In the first stage, his party has signed the Cooperation Agreement for the Coal to DME project. Currently, the process is awaiting signature from Pertamina Patra Niaga.
Then, his party is also carrying out a site investigation by Air Product Company Indonesia (APCI) and discussing land cost side agreements. Currently, a geotechnical survey has been carried out at the Coal to DME project site.
""We have also done and are currently doing this and address readiness in the field. Of course, we and Air Products as a processing company are conducting an assessment of the technical specifications for land preparation at the Coal to DME project site. We are doing this in detail, because that is the location. the land generally contains coal,"" continued Arsal.
In terms of carrying out sampling and analysis of Banko Tengah A coal specifications, his party has drilled at 32 points until November 2022. With a target of completing drilling at 7 points by December 2022.
""We have also carried out coal sampling and analysis of coal specifications which we are focusing on in the Banko Tengah A block. We have and are doing this and we have done it. There have been 30 more drilling points, and there are 7 points we are hoping for. finished in December,"" he said.""

(Lampung Tribune Print, 10/31/2014, lampung.tribunnews.com): ""Efforts to establish an integrated industrial area in Lampung have been carried out by the Lampung Provincial Government (Pemprov) since 2008. Even so, the area which was later called the Lampung Industrial Area (Kail), is still stagnant or has not experienced significant developments to date.
Lampung DPRD member Watoni Nurdin said the DPRD had submitted a revision to a regional regulation (perda) related to the legal basis for the management of the area by PT Kail. This was because Kail's development did not run optimally.
""Discussion on the revision of the 2012 regional regulations. From 2008 to 2012, PT Kail has never held a GMS (general meeting of shareholders). In fact, the GMS is one of them to make development plans. How can you proceed if you haven't even held a GMS,"" said Watoni, Thursday (30/10).
PT Kail is a consortium consisting of PT Lestari Sentosa Industrial Estate (LSIE, Sungai Budi Group), the central government, and the Provincial Government of Lampung. The three elements each have shares of 75 percent, 20 percent and 4 percent.
According to Watoni, the reason why the management of PT Kail has not held a GMS is because they have not received a recommendation from the Minister of State-Owned Enterprises (BUMN). ""But when the DPRD came to the Ministry of BUMN to confirm this, one of the director generals (Director General) at the ministry said it was not necessary. And the management of PT Kail has never submitted it to the ministry. How can a recommendation be dropped,"" said Watoni, who is also a member the special committee (pansus) for the revision of PT Kail's regional regulations in the DPRD for the 2009-2014 period.
Kail's condition, continued Watoni, did not even meet the requirements to become an industrial area. This is because supporting infrastructure for industrial activities has not been fulfilled, such as electricity networks, sewage channels, or road networks.
""In fact, there are no land plots for placing companies yet. The 300 hectares of land has not been added. He said, additional land is still a problem with PTPN. In fact, only 126 hectares have just been managed. Now, the area exists. However, it doesn't exist,"" said Indonesian Democratic Party of Struggle (PDIP) politician.
As a result of these conditions, Watoni revealed, the revision of the regional regulation failed to be finalized. The DPRD then wrote to the Governor of Lampung to replace the management of PT Kail.

(Babel Today, 11/14/2023, babeltoday.com): What's The News About The Sadai Industrial Area Project Worth Trillions? Billions Of State Funds Are At Risk Of Being 'Wasted' For Nothing
""Now there is almost no news about the development or progress of the Sadai Industrial Area (KIS) or Sadai Integrated Industrial and Port Estate (SIIPE) development project in the Sadai Village area, Tukak Sadai District, South Bangka Regency (Basel).
In fact, previously Justiar Noer, when he was still the Regent of Babel, admitted that he was very optimistic regarding plans in the Basel Regency area to build a project worth trillions of rupiah in an industrial area in the Sadai area, Basel which was predicted to cost hundreds of trillions and was targeted for completion in next 2024.
Apart from that, if this mega project is realized it is hoped that it can absorb hundreds of workers. Moreover, in the implementation of the construction of the KIS project, it was reported that the Bangka Belitung Islands High Prosecutor's Office (Kejati Babel) was actually the Strategic Project Development Security Team (TPPPS).
It is also known that in the KIS Basel project managed by PT RBA there are at least 25 main programs including the construction of ship barriers, electronics factories, tin smelting industry (semester), rare earth metal processing factories (rear earth), glass industry, tin waste, white pepper processing factory, container terminal and fuel oil (BBM) depot as well as B3 waste processing factory.
However, on the contrary, some parties, including the public, still doubt or doubt that this mega project can be realized because it is considered that the Basel Regency Government's APBD is inadequate and this hope now seems to be just a 'dream' that must be felt by itself.
So far, Justiar Noer has ended his position as Regent of South Bangka and is currently running as a DPD-RI candidate for the Bangka Belitung electoral district for the period 2024 – 2029.
Sadly, it is now reported that the KIS mega project is no longer running smoothly, aka 'stalled', because the private company or developer or manager of the KIS project, namely PT Ration Bangka Abadi (RBA), is currently allegedly facing problems. So what is the fate of the KIS mega project now?
Meanwhile, information gathered by the Bangka Belitung Online News Agency (KBO Babel) team in the field as well as information from a number of sources stated that especially in the KIS project development activities, the Basel Regency Government facilitated the provision of more than 400 hectares (ha) of land for the development of KIS.
* State projects worth billions are even built on privately owned land
However, other news also states that in the implementation of the construction of the KIS project or National Strategic Project, which was built in 2018, it is suspected that there have been errors or deviations, including regarding the status of the land as a location for work activities for the construction of raw water supply facilities or Resevoir Water Systems carried out under the auspices of Ministry of PUPR PJSA Working Unit for Bangka Belitung Region and PT Gala Karya – PT Graha Anugerah Lestari.
It is known that the project activity for raw water supply facilities or Reservoir Air System has a total funding ceiling of IDR 75,446,927,000,- or more than IDR 75.4 billion, sourced from APBN funds for the 2023 Fiscal Year (FY). KIS, Tukak Sadai., Toboali. The implementation was carried out by the PUPR Ministry, Directorate General of Water Data Resources, Bangka Belitung River Regional Office (BWS)
""The information is that the land status or location for the construction of the Reservoir Air System was built on land owned by PT RBA. Well, if the government wants to build this project (Reservoir Air System — ed), the land status must belong to the state and not private land. ""Unless a grant has been made, it must be done through a notarial deed,"" said this source to the KBO Babel team recently met in Sadai.
Not only that, at the KIS location, according to this source, it is also suspected that there have been irregularities in implementation or procedures, including, among other things, project activities for the construction of a B3 waste processing plant. This waste factory has now been built at the KIS location. However, the location for the construction of this waste factory was actually built on land still owned by PT RBA.
This source continued that regarding the implementation of work on the construction of the Reservoir Air System, it does not rule out the possibility that it will be threatened with being discovered by the Indonesian Financial Audit Agency (BPK) because it is suspected that there have been irregularities in the use of finances or the state budget.
Previously, it was reported that a team from the Indonesian Ministry of Public Works and Public Housing (PUPR), Thursday (14/11/2023) had visited the location of the Sadai Industrial Area (KIS) raw water supply project in Tukak Sadai District. The PUPR Ministry team was also accompanied by the Bangka Belitung Islands Prosecutor's Office and the South Bangka Prosecutor's Office.
* Asked about the KIS project, the former Regent of Basel admitted that he was focused on running for DPD-RI
Regarding the issue of the KIS development project, Tukak Sadai Basel, the KBO Babel team tried to contact the former Regent of Basel, Justiar Noer via short message/What's App (WA), Saturday (11/11/2023) afternoon but he answered flatly. He even stated that he is currently focused on preparing himself to run as a candidate for DPD-RI 2024-2029.
""Regarding Sadai (KIS - ed.), I haven't received any further information yet, I haven't had time to meet Agek's friends, now I'm busy with visits to friends for plans for the DPD RI legislative elections,"" Justiar answered briefly.
Likewise, when the KBO Babel team tried to confirm the progress of the KIS Basel development to the Regent of Basel, Reza Herdavid via WA message, Saturday (11/11/2023) evening he admitted that he did not know.
In fact, it is known that when the construction of the KiS Basel project began in 2020, Reza Herdavid was still serving as Deputy Regent of Basel.
""I'm not monitoring, bro,"" replied Reza briefly.
Next, the KBO Babel team also tried to visit the office of the SNVT Working Unit for the Implementation of the Bangka Belitung Water Utilization Network (PJSA) Bangka Belitung River Region Hall, Ministry of PUPR, Monday (11/13/2023) afternoon. However, unfortunately the head of this agency was not there that afternoon.
Meanwhile, Franky Alais Acai, Field Head of PT RBA, confirmed the progress of the KIS Basel development project, according to him, until now development activities are still ongoing. In fact, according to him, at the KIS location currently a B3 waste processing plant and a biomass power plant (PLTBM) have been built.
“Activities for the construction of the Sadai industrial area (KIS — ed) are currently still ongoing, sir. There is already construction at the KIS location, namely a B3 waste processing factory and PLTBM. ""And other work is currently underway, namely road construction work,"" said Franky when contacted via his cellphone, Monday (13/11/2023) afternoon.
It is known that the project activity for building a B3 waste processing plant at the KIS location is a project of the central Ministry of Environment & Activities (KLHK) and also involves Regional Owned Enterprises (BUMD) of the Babel Provincial Government.
When work began on building the B3 waste processing factory, the Director of BUMD (PT Bumi Bangka Belitung Sejahtera), Prof. Safarudin.
However, when Safarudin was confirmed by the KBO Babel team regarding the KIS Basel project activities involving the BUMD of the Babel Provincial Government, he admitted that at this time he did not know anything.
""I'm sorry, I'm no longer at BUMD Babel, and I'm also not involved in the Sadai Industrial Zone anymore. ""So I don't know any more information about KIS,"" he replied in a WA message Monday (13/11/2023) evening.
Likewise, when asked about the status of the land where the B3 waste factory was now built at the KIS location, he even admitted that the factory land was a grant.
""The land for the construction of the B3 waste factory was a grant from PT RBA to the Babel Provincial Government,"" he said. It was again asked whether there was any evidence that the land received a grant. However, Udin, as this man was known, did not answer. Instead, Udin explained something else. “Then BUMD is not implementing the project. ""The implementation is the Central Ministry of Environment,"" he said.
Separately, the Head of Legal Information (Penkum) of the Babel Prosecutor's Office, Basuki Raharjo SH MH, confirmed that the KIS development project activities in Tukak Sadai Village, Sadai District, South Bangka Regency were part of the Babel Prosecutor's Office as the PPPS team. However, Basuki admitted that he had not received this information.
""Sorry, haven't received any information?"" Basuki answered briefly via WA message received, Monday (11/13/2023) afternoon.

One of the PSNs in South Sulawesi is the construction of an Industrial Area, which is expected to attract investors and the economy in the Regency can improve and will be related to employment opportunities. In South Sulawesi there are two industrial areas, namely the Bantaeng Industrial Area and the Takalar Industrial Area
Specifically, the Takalar Industrial Area (KITA) became a PSN in the second period of President Joko Widodo together with Ma'aruf Amin, who collaborated with the State-Owned Enterprise (BUMN) PT Kawasan Berikat Nusantara (Persero).
From the information gathered, since the last few years PT KBN has developed the Takalar Integrated Industrial Park (TIIP) in Takalar Regency. This industrial area is planned to be built on 3,500 hectares of land with details 2 . 600 hectares for industrial areas, 100 hectares for port areas, 100 hectares for residential and commercial areas, and 45 hectares for golf areas.

For this reason, Setiawan stated that he had opened new communications with investors and was currently conducting assessments, including with the community in three villages related to the land there.
""We have also visited the respective communities in   the villages of Laikang, Punaga and Cikoang which are included in the industrial area, so that later when construction starts there will be no problems,"" he said.
Setiawan targets   to start acquiring around 100-200 hectares of land first.
Meanwhile, the Head of the South Sulawesi Province Industry and Trade Service, Ahmadi Akil, admitted that the collaboration with the third party, in this case KBN, had ended.
Ahmadi explained that with the expiry of the previous investor agreement with the regional government, it meant it could not continue.

Bob Kamandanu, Main Director of Delma Mining Corporation, said that until now the coal mining company and the government have not signed a contract amendment memorandum of understanding (MoU). This is because there are differing views regarding the royalty withdrawal point of 13.5% of the selling price...For your information, Delma Mining is included in group 12 out of 73 companies holding coal mining concession agreements (PKP2B) that have not signed an MoU on contract amendments to date.

Out of our 20,160 hectares of land, it doesn't mean that we can all mine there because there are lots of people's lands,"" he said when contacted by Bisnis today. Delma Mining is one of 12 Coal Mining Work Agreements (PKP2B) which are currently still in the construction stage and not yet in production. Since the PKP2B was signed on November 20, 1997, it means that it took almost 15 years for Delma to carry out production. The process towards production, continued Bob, took a lot of time starting from the exploration period for the first 5 years to delaying production considering that the company's coal products are low in calories, namely 2,800 KKal/Kg (GAR) ""In the past, our total land area was 100,000 hectares, now it is only 20,160 hectares after the exploration process and so on. After [the coal] is known to have low calories, it cannot be marketed yet,"" he said...In addition, in the company's long-term plan, apart from increasing Delma's production, it also plans to increase the added value of coal, such as gasifying coal and building a mine-mouth PLTU. the plan is 2013 and the capacity is not large.

""We have conveyed it to the Ministry of Maritime Affairs and Fisheries to build PLTS energy,"" said Belitung Deputy Regent Isyak Meirobie to Kompas.com , Wednesday (17/5/2023).
Isyak conveyed this regarding blackouts that often occur due to disruption of the Suge Steam Power Plant (PLTU). Previously there was a disturbance in the form of a furnace leak at the coal-fired generator. On Wednesday afternoon, disruption occurred again due to a lightning strike at a substation located in the PLTU area.
""It's no longer suitable for a leading destination like this, PLTU Suge can no longer afford it,"" said Isyak. Isyak hopes that the central government will immediately conduct a study for the construction of PLTS in Belitung, including estimates of costs and environmental impacts. The construction of PLTS is considered to be in line with the zero emissions or Net Zero Emissions (NZE) target which is targeted to be achieved by 2060. On the other hand, Isyak also expressed support if the government had alternative options to guarantee electricity supply in Belitung.

""We have already done the sounding with PLN, the only thing left now is the operation, everything is ready. The raw materials will be working with PT PUS for the CPO,"" said Sanem.
Sanem hopes that all people who have private oil palm plantations will sell their palm oil to PT PUS so that all fuel needs for this power plant can be met.
""Because there will be no term for palm oil to expire, all palm fruit goes into the factory process and is made into CPO. So the electricity will be purchased by PLN because PLN is the one who distributes it. It is also possible for companies in industrial areas to buy the electricity directly,"" he said. .
Sanem said this 5 MW power plant is environmentally friendly. ""We hope that factories in the Suge Industrial area will buy electrical power there. Even though PLN will buy the power later for distribution and this is really a pilot project in Indonesia,"" he said. (adv/tas)""

This analysis process is carried out with the help of an application called Greenwich. From the results of this analysis, almost all areas in Bantaeng have sufficient wind energy potential to build a PLTB. However, the picture from the Greenwich application must be strengthened by the construction of a wind measuring tower as a condition for applying for a permit at PT PLN. ""We have determined the location of this wind measuring tower. The point is in Bantaeng District,"" he explained. He said, in the near future, Envision will sign a collaboration with the Bantaeng Regency Government to start this project. After signing the agreement, Envision will start building this wind measuring tower.  ""This wind measuring tower will work for almost a year to ensure wind speed in Bantaeng,"" he explained.  Hermanto hopes that this cooperation with the Bantaeng Regency Government can be realized in the near future. He targets that this collaboration will be signed by the end of October. So that in early November, his party has started building this wind measuring tower.""
redaksibar.id, 3/23/2022: ""Two national-scale energy companies , PT Binatek Reka Energy and PT WPD Energy will start a Wind Power Plant ( PLTB ) project in Bantaeng. The two company leaders met with the Regent of Bantaeng , DR Ilham Azikin, to discuss licensing for this project.
This company designed three types of power plants in Bantaeng. The first power plant is the wind power plant (PLTB). There are two types of these generators, the first is the Offshore Wind PLTB which was built on the Bantaeng waterfront. There is also the construction of an Outshore Wind PLTB which will be built on land. There are two designs prepared. The first is the roof top model. This model is designed for use by companies that have not built construction at KIBA with the Roof Top model Solar Cell design. There is also development in an industrial area with a ground system that uses an area of ​​17 hectares. President Director of PT WPD Indonesia energy, Mr. Hans-Christoph Brumberg said, these two generating systems will be supported by a Hydro Power Plant (PLTA) which is designed with the Pump Storage model. This hydropower plant will use resources from one of the waterfalls in Bantaeng.

Dispute with local residents:
(IDN Times, 3/24/2022, Sulsel.idntimes.com): Residents Protest the Impact of Bantaeng Industrial Estate Activities
""Hundreds of residents of Pa'jukukang District, Bantaeng Regency, South Sulawesi, feel they are victims of the impact of the activities of companies operating in the Bantaeng Industrial Area (KIBA).
1. The company operates in residential areas
Ardi said KIBA is located in the coastal area of ​​Pa'jukukang District, Bantaeng. The land area of ​​this national strategic project reaches 3,151 hectares.""To support the company's activities, an export port and a 101 hectare wind power plant will be built in the Pa'jukukang waters,"" said Ardi. PT Huadi is the first smelter factory to be inaugurated in Bantaeng in January 2019 at KIBA. According to the local community, the company is said to have exported 15 times, starting from November 2018.vThere are three companies operating at KIBA. Namely, PT Huadi, Yatai and Wozhou. The company's operations are right next to the settlements of coastal residents in Papanloe Village. The seven hamlets in the village are directly affected by the activities of companies that produce materials for nickel raw materials.vThe coastal area of ​​Pa'jukukang is said to be designated as KIBA because it is considered dry and the land is unproductive. Even though most of the people there work as fishermen, seaweed farmers, the red stone manufacturing industry, and there are also rice fields. ""Especially in Papanloe Village, there are still 160 seaweed farmers, 114 of whom depend on the seaweed business,"" Ardi explained his data.
2. The company's activities destroy the source of income for residents
Ardi said the activity of material transport ships disrupted farmers' seaweed cultivation. Seaweed locations that meet directly with ports and ship lanes are often damaged by being hit by ships. As a result, the location of the stretch of seaweed is damaged and unable to continue cultivation. Not only disrupting seaweed cultivation, the activities of material transport vessels also disrupt fishermen's fishing grounds. Of the seven hamlets in Papanloe Village, Mawang Hamlet is the hamlet that feels the most impact from the company's activities. The common impact that occurs is pollution. ""Such as smell, dust and noise,"" said Ardi. Dust, sourced from several company activities. Such as dust from material transport vehicles that use village roads as well as public access roads used by residents. Another source of dust, comes from drying the ore to the burning process through the furnace. The combustion process is also a source of dust as well as emits a pungent odor. ""To describe the smell, residents call it the smell of scorched canvas. The noise for 24 hours comes from heavy equipment activity in the company area, material transport car activities, and sounds in the form of bangs,"" said Ardi. Not to mention the problem of drought. In September 2021, the residents' wells in the Balla Tinggia hamlet, Kayu Loe and Mawang hamlet, Papanloe Village dried up. The drought is thought to have been caused by the drilled wells built in the three companies' areas. As a result of the identification, there were 18 residents' wells that had dried up. Even though the well is used for the daily needs of local residents. ""Before it dries up, the residents use the well for bathing and washing, as well as meeting the water needs for making or for the production of red stone,"" said the resident of Papanloe Village.
3. Companies at KIBA are considered disobeying and ignoring the rules
Furthermore, Ardi explained, from the start of socialization by the government, companies at KIBA would prioritize recruiting local workers. The goal is that the people living around KIBA can improve their standard of living. But in practice, the company is considered to be in denial. Instead, they recruit more workers from outside. ""The company has not prioritized Papanloe residents in recruiting employees. Of the total number of employees as of October 2021, there were 1,255 people, while there were only 220 employees from Papanloe Village,"" said Ardi. Ardi added, residents have also taken various ways to submit their demands to the company. Starting from the village government to the local DPRD. ""But the problem really is with the company. Because it works without looking at the EIA, so there are a lot of impacts,"" he added. Confirmed separately, Community Development (Condev) PT. Huadi Nickel Alloy Indonesia Andi Rezky Darmawan Latippa said that his party had mediated the issue of residents' demands. ""We have received approximately 13 representatives from the community. The employee recruitment issue has been explained directly by our HRD manager,"" Rezky said in a written statement. Rezky said the environmental problems that residents complained about had also been explained to the local community. ""Our party has made several improvement efforts accompanied by the Ministry of Environment and Forestry and the Provincial Environmental Management Service in managing the environment based on applicable rules and laws,"" he said.""

(Kompas, 1/7/2023, kompas.com): The Tier 3 Data Center at KEK Nongsa Digital Park has a capacity of 40 MW
Secretary of the Coordinating Ministry for Economic Affairs Susiwijono Moegiarso reviewed the development of the Nongsa Digital Park (NDP) Special Economic Zone (KEK). Susiwijono said that his arrival at the Nonga Digital Park KEK was in order to follow up on the results of the meeting between the BP Batam Supervisory Board and the leadership within BP Batam. At the meeting, there was an agreement between the Supervisory Board and BP Batam to follow up on a number of potential new investments in the future. One of them is the potential for investment in the Nongsa Digital Park KEK. ""Because the Nongsa SEZ is our mainstay. ""Especially, related to the digital economy and also investments related to data centers and so on,"" explained Susiwijono.
The data center , which was built on an area of ​​28,730 square meters with an investment commitment of IDR 4 trillion from PT GDS IDC Service from Hong Kong, is a tier 3 data center with a capacity of 40 MW. This data center facility will be developed in two stages of 20 MW each. ""Earlier we saw that the progress was very good, so construction is really continuing. ""So we hope that this NDP KEK will encourage all sectors in Batam,"" explained Susiwijono. To support the smooth investment of the world's largest data center in the NDP SEZ, infrastructure support is needed to supply electrical energy and water. Regarding electricity and water needs, Susiwijono together with BP Batam and PLN Batam have discussed it, so that the supply that will be distributed to the NDP KEK can be maximally met.
This is done so that NDP SEZs can compete not only with neighboring countries such as Singapore and Malaysia. But it also competes with other world countries. “The government is very committed to continuing to encourage (fulfillment of needs) in order to increase competitiveness. ""So that our competitiveness can become an attraction for new investment here,"" explained Susiwijono. NDP CEO Mike Wiluan expressed his appreciation for the support provided by the central government and BP Batam. To date, there are three academies under the auspices of Infinite Learning. Starting from the IBM Academy, Apple Academy and Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology (RMIT) Academy. ""We are always looking for brands that are interested in and encourage the digital industry, we will bring them here,"" said Wiluan. In the future, Batam will become the center of digital technology education in Indonesia. NDP will accept new students from Java, Sumatra to Bali. “I would like to thank the Central Government and BP Batam for supporting the NDP.

(Batampos, 10/31/2022, batampos.co.id):  PLN Batam Ready to Meet the Electricity Needs of the Nongsa Digital Park KEK
""PLN Batam and PT. Internet Resort Park (Tamarin) officially established cooperation marked by the signing of a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) by the Main Director of PT PLN Batam, Irwansyah Putra and the Main Director of PT Tamarin, Michael Kristian Wiluan, which was held at Nongsa Point Marina, Friday ( 10/28).
This collaboration aims to provide and fulfill electrical power at the Data Center in the Nongsa Digital Park Special Economic Zone (KEK).
""In line with post-pandemic data center investment over the last two and a half years, it has become a magnet for data center investment from global companies. ""After we mapped it, at least the electricity demand for data center facilities in NDP alone reached around 449 MW until (year) 2030,"" said Irwansyah.
He added that this area needs electricity on a large scale. According to him, the electricity demand for data center facilities at NDP is almost equal to the electricity service on Batam Island for 22 years.
He said that the existing data center currently absorbs 43 MW of power. And in a matter of months, load demand increased by 90 percent.
""It is likely that it will increase again to 100 MW,"" he said.
The short-term and mitigation plans carried out by PT PLN Batam for this year are to increase electricity supply with PLTMG by 75 MW.
As for the details, this November the party hopes to complete the 25 MW PLTMG in Panaran and the plan is that another 50 MW will enter Batam's electricity system in August 2023.
Meanwhile, Mike Wiluan said that his party also needs collaboration and synergy between the government, in this case PLN and Tamarin from the private sector in order to provide and fulfill electricity needs for data centers.
Tamarin, which has been designated as the Nongsa SEZ, requires an electricity line of 530 Mega Watts until 2030.
""Tamarin has succeeded in attracting investors to build a data center in Nongsa and requires reliable and sustainable electric power in accordance with data center standards,"" he said.
So far, Tamarin has attracted investors to build a Data Center in Nongsa and requires reliable and sustainable electricity according to Data Center standards for TIER 3 and TIER 4. Where two electricity sources are needed and in the planning a solar power plant will be built to add backup electrical power source as well as Green Energy for the Data Center.

(Tanahair, 5/16/2023, tanahair.net): KAYAN HYDRO ENERGY RESUMING 9,000-MW HYDROPOWER PROJECT
""Kayan Hydro Energy (KHE) is resuming the development of the 9,000-megawatt (MW) hydropower power project in North Kalimantan after it has cleared up a legal dispute, Chief Executive Officer Andrew Suryali said.
“Now we can continue the works at the Cascade 1,” Suryali said.
The Jakarta Administrative Court recently ruled that KHE is the only company that has the permit to develop hydropower project in the Kayan River, annulling two other permits of two companies.
It was unclear how the two other companies obtained their permits. But, disputes like this are not uncommon in Indonesia due to the lack of legal clarity, analyst said.
KHE initiated in 2008 the Kayan Cascade project, which will consist of five dams along the Kayan River and equipped with five to six turbines.
The company in October 2022 signed an agreement with Sumitomo to co-develop the project, which is estimated to need around USD 17.8 billion in total investment. Prior to the agreement with Sumitomo, KHE had signed an agreement with China Power on 16 August 2019 for the same project, local media reported.
Yet, the company is still receptive to onboarding other investors into the mega project, t. It will prioritise potential investors who have already held talks with it or those who will be introduced by its partners, Suryali stated.
Initial infrastructure works have been done and KHE plans to start constructing the first dam diversion channel this year, Suryali had said on the sidelines of the KHE-Sumitomo signing ceremony on 6 October in Jakarta.
The first plant will have 900-MW capacity; the second, 1,200MW; while the third and fourth will have 1,800 MW each, and the fifth 3,400 MW. The first project is expected to be completed in 2025 or 2026, depending on weather conditions, said KHE’s Director of Operations Khaeroni.
KHE hoped to complete the rest of the project in two to three years after the completion of the first generation plant.
The power plants will supply electricity to the green industrial estate and an international sea port in North Kalimantan being developed by Indonesia Strategis Industri and other clients in Kalimantan, KHE said in a statement.""",0,Adaro Aluminum Smelter power station,N/A,"China

Environmental Impact:
Environmental groups in Indonesia and abroad have raised concerns and staged protests over the proposed building of new captive coal power plants for the industrial park. In Phase 1 and Phase 2 of KIPI’s development, Adaro plans to build approximately 1000 MW capacity of coal power plants in each phase, before the anticipated hydroelectric power plants are ready to operate. In February 2023, it was reported that Adaro was having trouble finding financing for the development of their coal power plants, as many international banks that Adaro had previously borrowed from had pledged to stop supporting new coal projects (ft.com, 2/6/2023). Environmental groups also called out Hyundai, who plans to use aluminum from the smelter for electric vehicle production, for violating its own carbon neutrality principles. At Adaro’s 2023 annual shareholders’ meeting in May, two of its own shareholders protested against the planned captive power plants (news.mongabay.com, 6/15/2023). Mongabay also reported that it is unlikely the captive coal plants will be shut down in 2030, once hydropower is available, as the master plan for KIPI designates a zone of the park that is permitted to use power from coal power plants (news.mongabay.com, 6/15/2023). In May 2023, Adaro had only secured funding from domestic Indonesian banks for the first phase of the coal power plant development (1,060 MW capacity).

(Mongabay, 6/15/2023, new.mongabay.com): Indonesian coal giant Adaro’s ‘sustainable’ smelter slammed as ‘greenwashing’
""Indonesia’s largest coal miner, PT Adaro Energy, faces claims of greenwashing over its plan to build coal-fired power plants on the island of Borneo to provide electricity for its aluminum smelter there.
At its annual shareholders’ meeting in Jakarta on May 11, two shareholders protested against the planned captive power plants, known as such because they’re designed specifically to supply certain industries and not to feed into the grid.
“Stop the development of new coal plants. One billion people will be threatened by the climate crisis due to coal plants,” one of the shareholders shouted while being escorted out of the meeting.
The plants, with a combined capacity of 2.2 gigawatts, will supply Adaro’s aluminum smelter in an industrial park, itself branded as “green,” in North Kalimantan province. The park is being touted, once completed, as the largest of its kind in the world, home to Indonesia’s first electric vehicle battery production, alongside petrochemical and aluminum industries.
The smelter project, estimated to cost $2 billion, has entered the preconstruction phase and is expected to start commercial operation in 2025. Once running at full capacity in 2029, it will be able to produce 1.5 million metric tons of aluminum a year, the company says.
Aluminum is used in the lithium nickel-cobalt-aluminum oxide (NCA) cathodes that are the most widely cathodes currently found in EV batteries. Because of this, and the adjacent EV battery plant in the industrial park, Adaro is marketing the aluminum smelter project as a flagship green and renewable development for Indonesia.
“Seeing the future development of electric vehicle (EV), the Company is ready to participate in providing aluminium for the EV’s material and support green economy for sustainable living,” Adaro said in a filing to the Jakarta stock exchange.
But building the smelter will start with building the coal-fired power plants to run them. Only later, in 2030, will the smelter switch to using power from a hydroelectric plant.
Adaro said that while the main power source for the industrial park will be renewables, coal will still be needed in the initial stages of the smelter as it takes longer to build renewable power plants.
Binbin Mariana, Southeast Asia energy finance campaigner at climate group Market Forces, noted that state-owned aluminum producer PT Indonesia Asahan Aluminium (Inalum) is also building a smelter in North Sumatra province — powered by two hydro plants.
“By using hydropower plants, the cost of the aluminium production is much cheaper compared to using coal-fired power plants,” she said. “The cost if using hydropower is less than 5 U.S. cents per kilowatt-hour, compared to 6 to 8 U.S. cents if using coal.”
And even after Adaro makes the switch in 2030, it’s not clear whether the captive coal plants will be decommissioned, according to the Center of Economic and Law Studies (CELIOS), a Jakarta-based research institute.
“Is there any guarantee that when the hydropower plant is ready, the captive coal plants will be shut down? No,” CELIOS executive director Bhima Yudhistira said.
He added that’s because the master plan for the “green” industrial park explicitly allows coal power: the estate’s environmental impact assessment maps out two zones, green and blue, with factories and smelters in the blue zone permitted to use power from coal plants.
Even using the best available technology to minimize emissions, the captive plants will still emit an estimated 5.2 million metric tons of greenhouse gases per year, according to Market Forces.
Greenpeace Indonesia energy campaigner Bondan Andriyanu said this goes against the Indonesian government’s pledge to phase out coal and switch to renewables in a bid to mitigate climate change. The planned coal plants will also dash any hope of meeting the wider goal to limit global temperature rise to 1.5° Celsius (2.7° Fahrenheit) above pre-industrial levels.
The International Energy Agency says there can be no new coal-fired power plants after 2021 if the world is to stay within this threshold, agreed on by nations including Indonesia in the Paris climate pact to avoid the most catastrophic impacts of climate change.
“The development of a new coal plant will only exacerbate the impact of the climate crisis, pollute the environment, harm the people and Indonesia’s commitment in reducing carbon emissions from the energy sector,” Bondan said.
Less money for coal
Nabilla Gunawan, Indonesia campaigner for Market Forces, called the smelter project “greenwashing” since it’s being marketed as sustainable. With other environmental groups also pointing this out, Adaro has reportedly struggled to raise money from international banks to finance the project.
The company had planned to get $1.1 billion in bank loans to help meet the $2 billion price tag, but several global banks that had previously done business with Adaro now say they won’t finance the smelter. This includes Singapore’s DBS and OCBC, and the U.K.’s Standard Chartered.
For coal companies like Adaro, it’s becoming increasingly difficult to get funding as a growing number of banks and investment funds announce their commitments to tackling climate change by no longer funding industries that contribute to greenhouse gas emissions, according to Binbin of Market Forces.
Many of these institutions are part of the U.N.’s Net-Zero Banking Alliance, accounting for about 40% of global banking assets. To date, 115 banks in 41 countries have joined the alliance.
That leaves a shrinking pool of banks willing to fund coal, especially for companies like Adaro, which not only plans to build new power plants, but also still has plans to prospect for new coal reserves, Binbin said.
“What’s funny is that if you look at Adaro’s annual report in 2021, it says that they’re still exploring new mines,” she said.
Adaro’s coal production hit a record high in 2022, amounting to 62.8 million metric tons, a 19% increase from the 52.7 million tons it mined in 2021, casting further doubt on the company’s commitment to transition away from coal.
Adaro Minerals, the subsidiary in charge of the smelter project, has denied that the company is struggling to get funding for the project.
“The rumor is not true,” Adaro Minerals director Wito Krisnahadi said as quoted by CNBC Indonesia, adding that they’ve been able to secure financing from at least five banks.
Wito declined to name the banks.
Adaro Energy’s head of corporate communications, Febriati Nadira, said separately that the company is in the process of finalizing the deal to finance the project.
Adaro Minerals has also denied allegations of greenwashing. President director Christian Ariano Rachmat said the company remains committed to transitioning toward green energy, but will need time to build the hydropower plant to meet the aluminum smelter’s demand for electricity.
Christian also said that three-quarters of aluminum smelters around the world still use coal, hence Adaro’s case wasn’t an outlier.
“One day, we want to produce green aluminium, but it needs time to get there, at least until our hydro [plant] is finished,” he said.
Hyundai driving into controversy
Besides Adaro, critics have also gone after South Korean automobile giant Hyundai, which signed an agreement in November 2022 to buy aluminum from Adaro for its EV production. Hyundai described the aluminum as “green and low-carbon” because it would be produced using hydroelectric power, and thus would “accelerate” the transition to sustainable energy and help the company meet its net-zero emissions goal by 2045.
But the agreement fails to mention that hydropower will only come into the mix at a later stage, with the smelter initially relying on burning coal. That makes any purchase of aluminum from Adaro’s smelters a violation of Hyundai’s Carbon Neutrality Principles, Binbin said.
Those principles require Hyundai to cut not just its own emissions, but also those emissions associated with assets it doesn’t own — like the aluminum it plans to buy from Adaro. These are known as Scope 3 emissions, and in 2022 Hyundai reported 18.3 million metric tons of Scope 3 emissions from its supply chain, up from 17 million metric tons in 2021.
“This means that this 18 million tons of emissions have to be reduced,” Binbin said. “But if Hyundai buys aluminium from Adaro, the emissions [from its supply chain] will increase. So this doesn’t make any sense.”
UPDATE: On 12 May 2023, the deal to finance the smelter project reached financial closing. A group of five Indonesian domestic banks – Mandiri Bank, Bank Negara Indonesia (BNI), Bank Central Asia (BCA), Bank Rakyat Indonesia (BRI), Permata Bank – provided a total of 2.5 trillion rupiah (US$166.8 million) and US$1.5 billion loans to Adaro’s smelter and coal power plant subsidiaries, Kalimantan Aluminium Industry (KAI), and Kaltara Power Indonesia (KPI).""

(Petrominer, 3/14/2023, Petrominer.com): Signed MoU with Adaro, Questioned Hyundai's Climate Commitment
""A coalition of environmental organizations from Indonesia and South Korea has raised concerns over the memorandum of understanding (MoU) signed by Hyundai Motor Company and PT Adaro Minerals Indonesia Tbk. The reason is that, based on the MoU, Hyundai can buy a maximum of 100,000 tons of aluminum per year from Adaro. Meanwhile, Adaro plans to build a new 1.1 GW coal-fired power plant as an energy source to produce aluminum.
Responding to this problem, 10 environmental organizations from Indonesia and Korea have sent an objection letter to Hyundai on January 24, 2023. They also expressed their concerns over the cooperation plan, but until now Hyundai has not responded.
""We have expressed our concerns and sent a letter to Hyundai in January, but until now Hyundai has not updated our letter,"" said Campaigner from Market Forces, Nabilla Gunawan, Monday (13/3).
According to Nabilla, this partnership with Adaro is in direct conflict with Hyundai's climate commitments. The reason is that Hyundai failed to take into account the consequences of building a new coal-fired power plant on the climate and environment.
""Hyundai has reneged on its commitment to environmentally friendly vehicles by using aluminum produced using a new coal-fired power plant,"" he said.
Even though Adaro labels this aluminum smelter project as an 'environmentally friendly' project, the initial phase of the smelter will use electricity from a new coal fired power plant. In fact, the average PLTU in the world operates for 46 years, meaning that it will be difficult for Hyundai to achieve the carbon neutral target in 2045 if Hyundai still relies on aluminum produced from Adaro's coal energy.
""Electric vehicle consumers are increasingly skeptical that the goal of the energy transition is still littered with the massive use of coal,"" said Bhima Yudhistira from the Center of Economic and Law Studies (CELIOS).
On the previous occasion, the National Coordinator of the Mining Advocacy Network (JATAM), Melky Nahar, said that Indonesia does not need new coal-fired power plants which clearly pollute and damage the environment. Companies like Adaro have a history of destroying people's lives and have contributed to environmental disasters such as floods and landslides in Kalimantan.”
“We were very concerned about Hyundai signing a memorandum of understanding to purchase aluminum produced by Adaro, when it became clear that the production would be supported by a new coal-fired power plant. Hyundai should not support dirty aluminum production by Adaro and encourage low-carbon investment in Indonesia,"" said Melky.
Currently, Adaro's aluminum smelter is known to have a planned capacity of 1.5 million tons per year in 2029. Adaro plans to rely on coal-fired power plants in the early stages, then add capacity from hydropower in the final stage.""",1,0,1,0,0,0,Aluminum,"Aluminum, petrochemicals, electric cars, steel, iron, semiconductor chips

(Aizhu & Nangoy, 5/15/2023, reuters.com): Shandong Nanshan may expand Indonesia site into $6 bln aluminium complex
""China's Shandong Nanshan plans to expand its new Indonesian alumina plant to a $6 billion aluminium smelting complex by 2028, a company executive said, which would be among the largest foreign investments in the resource-rich nation.
Shandong Nanshan (600219.SS) is among a growing group of private Chinese companies making multi-billion-dollar investments in Southeast Asia in sectors such as metal processing and oil refining amid a cooling Chinese economy and tighter regulatory scrutiny at home.
The company started up its 2 million tonnes per year (tpy) alumina facility last November at the Galang Batang special economic zone (SEZ) on the island of Bintan, located about one hour by ferry from Singapore.
Now running at full capacity, Nanshan processes bauxite mined from Indonesia's Kalimantan region and exports alumina to neighbouring Malaysia and also sells to international traders.
Nanshan, with plans to bring more Chinese firms to the site, intends to start building a 250,000-tpy aluminium smelting unit later this year, part of a plan to construct a 1 million-tpy aluminium plant by 2028, a company executive said last week, asking to remain unidentified, eventually producing high-end aluminium ingots for the aircraft and electric vehicle industries.
Based in China's Shandong province, Nanshan Group says its existing aluminium customers include Airbus, Boeing and Tesla.
To fuel the alumina facility, Nanshan operates a 160-megawatt (MW) coal-based power plant within the SEZ. The site's general manager, Hao Weisong, said on Tuesday that the company plans a 100-MW solar power facility and has also agreed to buy renewable power from state utility Perusahaan Listrik Negara.
The SEZ's operating company, PT Bintan Alumina Indonesia, was last year granted a full waiver of income tax for 20 years, Susiwijono Moegiarso, secretary general of the National Council of Special Economic Zones, said on Friday.
He said investment at the site has thus far totalled 17 trillion rupiah ($1.16 billion).
Indonesian President Joko Widodo, who visited the site last year, is focusing on minerals processing to extract more value from its vast mining sector, and the government may impose an export ban in June on unprocessed minerals, including bauxite.
Moegiarso said that the SEZ has committed to supplying 33.8% of its power from renewable sources by 2032.""

(Panama, 2/25/2023, kepri.antaranews.com): Investment realization in the Galang Batang Bintan SEZ reached IDR 19 trillion
""The government of Bintan Regency, Riau Archipelago, noted that investment realization in the Galang Batang Special Economic Zones (KEK) reached IDR 19 trillion in the last three years.
Indra Hidayat, Head of the Bintan One-Stop Integrated Investment and Licensing Agency, said in Bintan on Friday that the company building the alumina industry in the Galang Batang SEZ continues to develops its business.
The business of processing bauxite into alumina power is growing rapidly, marked by production figures increasing from 1 million tons to 2 million tons in early 2023.
""""Alumina power from local bauxite processing is exported to China, India and Malaysia,"""" he said.
According to him, PT Bintan Alumina Indonesia (BAI), a foreign investment company that manages the Galang Batang SEZ, has not been affected by the COVID-19 pandemic at all. The company continues to develop industrial areas and prepare for various other industries, apart from alumina pulp.
At the end of the year, he said, PT Bai will start exploring the alumina bar industry, which will be exported to various countries. Accordingly, the company will build a new steam power plant with a capacity of 1,200 MW.
""""The existing steam power plant with a capacity of 125 MW is not sufficient, so it is being built again with a capacity of 1,200 MW,"""" he said.
The company has also started to crawl to Poto Island, Bintan Pesisir district to develop petrochemical industry businesses, chemical recycling and others. The government has granted a location permit to manage the 1,200 hectares of land on the island.
""""The investment target to be invested reaches IDR 150 trillion,"""" he said.
The number of local workers in the Galang Batang SEZ reaches 3,000 people, while foreign workers who have expertise are as many as 1,000 people.
""""This company certainly needs more workers when the industry on Poto Island is running,"""" he said.""

Adi added, """"Currently, PLN's electricity supply for the Sumatra region is already qualified with a power surplus of 1,710 MW. As the capacity of NRE power plants increases in 2026, there will be enough power available that the mining community in Sumatra can absorb.""""
PT BAI's President Director, Santoni, welcomed the signing of this MoU because it will support the aluminium utilization industry in the Galang Batang SEZ. Especially for PT BAI, that will be building an aluminium smelter with a production capacity of 250,000 tonnes of aluminium annually.
""""This cooperation will be mutually beneficial. The aluminium industry and its derivatives require a large amount of electrical energy. Especially for the Galang Batang SEZ, we will need 2,850 MW in the near future,” said Santoni.
Santoni continued that PT BAI will follow government regulations to use EBT-based electricity in supplying electrical energy. So, according to him, the MoU with PLN is an alternative for the provision of EBT for PT BAI.
""""Hopefully, through this MoU, PLN can provide reliable and economical electricity supply. Hopefully, the realization of this collaboration can build a productive smelter for the downstream industry of aluminium derivatives and various other industries that will be present in the Galang Batang SEZ,"""" explained Santoni.
Agung Murdifi, the PLN Main Unit General Manager for Riau and Riau Islands, said, """"This momentum was an opportunity for both parties to increase the supply and use of EBT in the industrial sector. Until July 2022, PLN's EBT mix for the Sumatra region is 27.94 per cent or equivalent to 2,427 MW, with the majority using water energy (PLTA).""""
""""This memorandum of understanding proves that PT BAI is very committed to supplying industrial electricity from NRE. This follows the government's decision to achieve 23 per cent of the NRE mix by 2025. This commitment to clean energy is certainly our collective obligation,"""" concluded Agung.""

(Pemerintah Provinsi Kepulauan Riau, 1/24/2022, kepriprov.go.id): ""The details of the investment development stages so far are the existence of an alumina  refinery, a PLTU with a capacity of 6x25 MW, a gas station  as a downstream coal for roasting alumina, and a dormitory for worker accommodation.

""The cut and fill activity carried out by PT Bintan Alumina Indonesia (BAI) on one of the hills in Galang Batang, Gunung Kijang District, Bintan Regency, had become a public concern.
Moreover, cut and fill activities which are considered by many parties to have an impact on environmental damage, continue to be of public concern, especially environmentalists.
However, regarding the cut and fill carried out by PT BAI, the Head of Forestry Management and Forest Product Utilization of the Riau Islands DLHK, Bherly Andia, said that the area being cut and filled was no longer a limited production forest (HPT) area, but already APL.
""PT BAI's cut and fill land on the Galang Batang hill is already an APL bleaching area (another use area). Previously it was an HPT area, but a partial release has been made from HPT to HPK (convertible production forest), and finally it became an APL area. ""explained Bherly Andia when met in his office, Tuesday (7/3/2023).
Meanwhile, the Riau Islands ESDM Service explained that regarding the cut and fill carried out by PT BAI in Galang Batang, there was no permit yet. However, if the cut and lill location is included in the Galang Batang Bintan Special Economic Zone (KEK), no permit is required.
He added, for now in Galang Batang there is only 1 mining permit, namely PT. Graha Mandala Bintan (GNB). However, the company is still in the exploration stage, not yet in production operations.
But for PT BAI, because the cut and fill location is included in the KEK Galang Batang area, a permit is no longer needed as long as the excavated products are used for themselves and not for sale,"" said Head of Technical and Environmental Mining Engineering at the ESDM Kepri Office, Reza Muzzamil Jufri.
The main director of PT BAI Santoni, who confirmed via cellular, said that his party would not work arbitrarily without a permit. Especially those that come into contact with the environment, said Santoni, his party is very careful.
""Is it possible for a project of this size to play haphazardly without a permit. In terms of the HPT forest area land issue that was alleged to have been damaged by PT BAI, that is not true because we have made an application to the Ministry of Forestry.

However, the Project Development Kick Off Ceremony was carried out by the Board of Directors together with the Board of Commissioners of Pupuk Kaltim, Tuesday, 10 January 2023.
""As far as I can see, there is no mention of PT. Pupuk Kalimantan Timur as the PSN of the Fertilizer Industrial Area in Fakfak Regency, West Papua in the Presidential Decree, including in its several amendments.

In this regard, the Deputy Chairman of Committee I DPD RI reminded about the experience of the 7 ethnic communities in Teluk Bintuni Regency regarding BP Tangguh.

This means that the government is required to have a policy to deal with social impacts, for example the rejection of indigenous peoples, refusal of compensation, including the environmental impacts caused.
“The question is, has the regional government proposed the form or type of social impact to be analyzed by the central government? Traumatic experiences of indigenous peoples in West Papua related to development have often been experienced. Don't let this backfire on the government because the PP emphasizes that the minister facilitates problem solving in business licensing and land acquisition for National Strategic Projects,"" he said.
""In this PP, Ministers, governors and/or regents/mayors must prepare programs and budgets for handling social impacts for directly affected communities, namely people who control state land or land owned by the Central Government, Regional Governments, BUMN, or regionally owned enterprises, communities with land rights, or communities experiencing direct and measurable losses. Thus, social impacts, for example land acquisition for PSN in West Papua, must be resolved in an integrated, effective and efficient manner, without leaving prolonged conflicts,"" Filep added.
On the same occasion, Senator Filep also highlighted the dissemination which he considered not sufficiently heard regarding the location of the Pupuk Kaltim project.

“Our first batch of nickel and cobalt hydroxide products will be shipped to China soon, and gradually enter the global market,” said Lygend’s president Jiang Xinfang.
Jiang said that Lygend Resources and its Indonesian partner Harita Group plan to build other projects on Obi island to make nickel sulphate, precursors and stainless steel-related products.
“It means that there is a viable path to produce battery grade nickel with a reasonably low capital cost and a relatively short project timeline,” said independent consultant Steven Brown.
“With the nickel market already in surplus, we can expect the nickel price to drop if the commissioning process continues at this pace,” Brown added.
Lygend has been able to tap Chinese contractor Enfi Engineering Corp, which has experience in HPAL in Papua New Guinea, to design its project and benefit from relatively low-cost labour and nickel ore costs in Indonesia.

(Kompas, 4/10/2023, lestari.kompas.com): Already has PSN status, what is the progress of the Obi Island nickel industrial area?
""SOUTH HALMAHERA, KOMPAS.com -  The Obi Island Industrial Area, in South Halmahera Regency, North Maluku Province, has changed its status from provincial to National Scale Development, since 2020. This follows the publication of Presidential Regulation (Pepres) of the Republic of Indonesia Number 109 of 2020, concerning the Third Amendment to Presidential Decree Number 3 of 2016 concerning the Acceleration of Implementation of National Strategic Projects. Then  the Regulation of the Coordinating Minister (Permen) for Economic Affairs Number 21 of 2022 concerning the Second Amendment to the Coordinating Minister for Economic Affairs Regulation Number 7 of 2021 concerning Changes to the PSN List. With this change in status, all kinds of supporting infrastructure for the Obi Island Industrial Area will be handled by the Ministry of Public Works and Public Housing (PUPR).
How is the progress currently? The industrial area built by PT Trimegah Bangun Persada (TPB) or Harita Nickel through the entity PT Dharma Cipta Mulia (DCM) is projected to require investment funds worth IDR 31.32 trillion. Director of Health, Safety and Environmental Operations Department of Harita Nickel Group, Tonny Gultom, said that the Obi Island Industrial Area was designed as a  green industrial park . ""It occupies 15,000 hectares of land and will be worked on in a former mining area,"" said Tonny on Obi Island, Saturday (8/9/2023). Currently, the Company is preparing a feasibility study , parallel to the master plan .
Tony revealed that the two stages of preparation are targeted to be approved, and then move on to the next step, namely an environmental impact analysis (AMDAL) in 2023. ""If  the master plan  is successful,  the feasibility study  is approved, the AMDAL is safe this year, then offers to investors will begin immediately,"" continued Tonny. On Obi Island itself, currently  tenants or affiliated companies are operating, namely PT Gane Permai Sentosa, PT Halmahera Jaya Feronikel and PT Megah Surya Pertiwi (MSP), including another partner company, PT Halmahera Persada Lygend (HPAL).
MSP operates a smelter with a production capacity of 240,000 tons of ferronickel (FeNi) per year from four production lines. With nickel saprolite as raw material, nickel ore is processed through a pyrometallurgical system using Rotary Kiln-Electric Furnace (RKEF) technology. Ferronickel has a nickel content of 10-12 percent and is a semi-finished processed product which is further processed into the final product as raw material for the stainless steel industry, electronics, coins, transportation and household goods. Meanwhile, HPAL is an entity whose 45.1 percent shares are owned by TBP. This pioneer industry produces mixed hydroxide precipitate (MHP) and end products nickel sulfate and cobalt sulfate. Nickel sulfate (NiSO4) is useful as a precursor material for lithium batteries or electric vehicle batteries, while cobalt sulfate (CoSO4) is used as a cathode material for lithium batteries.
With the operation of MSP and HPAL, DCM decided to carry out future development as a form of mining transformation towards downstreaming. ""Because we have large reserves.  We are currently exploring two more IUPs which we will develop. The industrial area we will build is an industrial area based on nickel mining. The derivative of nickel is what we call transformation,"" explained Tonny. Therefore, he continued, the Obi Island Industrial Area will be designed with the concept of a nickel mining-based industrial area. The company opens  opportunities for investors to develop its downstream direction, including stainless steel products, electric car components, to nickel sulfate and cobalt sulfate. In the infrastructure sector, the Company ensures that it will expand ports, build airports and road infrastructure as well as a Solar Power Plant (PTSL) with a capacity of 300 MegaWatt and raw water. Tonny confirmed that the company's commitment is to carry out the government's mandate by optimizing the added value of nickel resources and providing optimal benefits. ""We realize this commitment through operations that are responsible for the environment, society and good governance,"" he said.""

(Jatam, 4/12/2023, jatam.org): Action at IDX: Community Reveals Harita Group's Trail of Environmental and Humanitarian Crimes
""Today (12/4), people from Obi Island, North Maluku along with JATAM, Enter Nusantara and Trend Asia held a direct communication action at the Indonesia Stock Exchange (IDX) office, Jakarta on the first day of PT Trimegah Bangun Persada Tbk (NCKL) conducting an Initial Public Offering (IPO) to the public. The community submitted a report document containing traces of environmental and humanitarian crimes from NCKL company’s operations in Kawasi, Obi Island, South Halmahera, North Maluku Province.
The Harita Group subsidiary is projected to gain an increase in net worth from USD 1.1 billion to USD 4.6 billion. This action was carried out to convey to brokers, as public intermediaries in buying and selling shares related to the dangers of investing in NCKL.
PT Trimegah Bangun Persada Tbk (NCKL) is a subsidiary of Harita Group that operates the first High Pressure Acid Leaching (HPAL) smelter on Obi Island, North Maluku. The company produces 60,000 tons of nickel per year. HPAL technology will convert local low-grade ore into mixed hydroxide deposits, a form of nickel that can further be processed to make batteries.
In its operations, PT Trimegah Bagun Persada, along with PT Gane Sentosa Permai, PT Halmahera Persada Lygend, PT Megah Surya Pertiwi, and PT Halmahera Jaya Feronickel on Obi Island, all companies under the auspices of Harita Group, have devastated the land / plantation land of residents, polluted water sources, river water, and sea water, polluted the air due to dust and pollution that has an impact on the health of residents, to trigger social conflicts due to intimidation and repeated violence against residents who defend their living spaces. PT Trimegah Bangun Persada and  a number of other companies owned by Harita Group also unilaterally annexed residents’ land without fair negotiation and compensation.
“Lili Mangundap and four other families who owned land in Kawasi village were annexed by the company. The company and the South Halmahera Regency government also plan to relocate Kawasi residents to Eco Village Housing, located 5 kilometers to the south of Kawasi. For residents, this relocation not only removes them from their homes, but also robs them of their cultural and historical values. Not only that, residents are also excluded from their sources of life such as land, fields, and the sea,” said Muhammad Jamil, Head of the Legal Division of JATAM Nasional.
Harita Group’s mining operations resulted in polluted water sources of Kawasi residents and sedimentation of nickel ore from the company’s operations. Before the mine came in and operated, residents could get water for free, but now they have to spend money to get clean water. This condition makes it more difficult for residents who are economically deprived because they are forced to use polluted water sources. PT Trimegah Bangun Persada and other Harita Group-owned companies in the region dump waste into rivers and flow into the sea. This causes the coast and sea to turn cloudy-brownish. The marine ecosystem on Obi Island is damaged by sewage pipes leading to the sea. The fish that have been consumed by residents are also contaminated with heavy metals.
In addition to pollution in the sea, the company’s activities are so close to settlements, that residents are forced to deal with dust, noise, and a dirty environment. During the dry season, kitchen utensils, dining tables, chairs, floors, and even in the room are full of dust from company activities and coal dust. Based on information from residents and officials at Kawasi health clinic, acute respiratory infections (ARI) are the most important health problem in Kawasi. Most patients are toddlers. There were 124 infants aged 0-1 years who visited the health clinic from January to December 2021. Toddlers aged 1-5 years were recorded as many as 283, followed by the age group of 20-44 years as many as 179 people.
In addition to bringing health problems, Harita Group’s operations also ignore the OHS Compliance aspect of its workers. Throughout 2022, the mining and mineral processing sector dominated accidents in North Maluku, especially belonging to Harita Group. Based on media reports, in the 2019-2023 time frames, 8 cases were recorded with 2 victims died and 5 people were injured. This fact refutes Harita Group’s claim that there were no casualties due to work accidents. In nickel mining operations, Harita Group, through PT Halmahera Persada Lygend (HPL), also uses coal-fired power plants for operations. The total capacity of the coal-fired power plant is 210 MW. PT HPL is a joint venture between Harita Group and Ningbo Lygend from China which has around 2,030 MW of coal-fired power plants in the process of construction and pre-permitting. The company also targets a total of 4,200 MW of coal-fired power plants on Obi Island. The construction of the power plant violates the commitment of Chinese President, Xi Jinping, through his speech in 2021, which stated that he would not build new power plants abroad.
“With all the environmental and social damage made by Harita Group, the company has underwriters, namely Credit Suisse Group, BNP Paribas, Citigroup, Mandiri Sekuritas, DBS, OCBS Securities, and UOB Kay Hian. six underwriters from Harita Group companies -except Mandiri Sekuritas, are members of the Net-Zero Banking Alliance. Their collaboration with Harita Group certainly undermines GFANZ’s commitment itself in supporting the achievement of zero emission targets and a just clean energy transition,” said Novita Indri, a campaigner from Trend Asia.""

-  ""The community consisting of religious leaders, traditional leaders, village government and cross-organizations approached the South Halmahera DPRD, questioning the news about the Kawasi Village relocation plan after the nickel mining company, PT Harita Group, began operating on Obi Island. The Kawasi community did not receive an explanation or reason from the government why they had to relocate their village.
- This non-transparent relocation plan was followed by the process of building houses and public facilities in an area called Eco Village, about three kilometers from Kawasi Village.
- Obet Siar, a youth leader from the Maluku Protestant Church Youth Generation (AMGPM) in the Obi Islands area , said that the land the Kawasi people live in is the ancestral heritage of the Kawasi people. The land is engraved with the identity of the Kawasi people. Therefore, if the Kawasi people are relocated, it means that they are indirectly removed from their cultural roots and identity as Kawasi people.
-  Muhlis Djafaar, Chairperson of the South Halmahera DPRD , asked the local government to openly and in real terms convey to the community the reasons for wanting to move them from the village at this time. Village relocation must also be placed sociologically, anthropologically and academically.""
Environmental impact: ""Starting from environmental damage such as environmental pollution to social problems that cannot be handled properly. The negative impact currently being experienced by the Kawasi people, he said, is that floods inundate their homes every time due to excavation and felling of trees on the Kawasi hill.
At present, he said, the residents' river water is brown, garbage piles up in community settlements, dust threatens health and other environmental problems.
The social impact, he said, was the practice of prostitution in the village, fights between residents, and gambling was rife.""
Fishing: ""Difficult conditions were also felt at sea. Before there were mining companies, fishing was easy. Now, on the other hand. ""Compared to fishing one hour ago with now one day.

The target is that the CPP is claimed to supply energy sources for the development of nickel smelters as raw materials for the battery industry...This project also has a negative impact on the people living around the project area. Lily Mangundap, as in her interview in Project Multatuli, said that this nickel smelter industry project had slowly “killed” her and her family.

Environmental degradation, health problems for local residents, resident loss of access to clean water, forced relocation, potential improper waste disposal

(Washington Post, 5/10/2023 washingtonpost.com): To meet EV demand, industry turns to technology long deemed hazardous
""...One afternoon late last year, Liyus, a 52-year-old farmer on Obira, walked along the coast where his family has lived for four generations. It’s been quiet on this island for most of his life. Without a private jet, getting to Obira from the Indonesian capital, Jakarta, is at least a two-day journey involving an overnight ferry and hours of driving on roads stippled with potholes.
Liyus, who goes by one name, said he used to drink from the rivers that run past his village, but since the nickel mine added its acid-leaching refinery two years ago, the waterways have turned dark red, so thick with pollution at some points that rows of coconut trees have been killed off. He doesn’t know what’s in the water, only that it bleeds into the sea and that his nephews have had to go farther and farther out to find fish. He pointed to a fishing net drying on a nearby tree. It was stained a reddish brown.
In an hour-long interview, representatives from the two companies that jointly own the processing plant on Obira island — an Indonesian firm, Harita Group, and a Chinese firm, Lygend Resources — said that the operation has not had a negative impact on the environment and that the pollution along the coast was not related to waste produced by their plant. All of their operations, they emphasized, are in “full compliance” with government requirements. “We looked at what was the best and we confirmed it with the government,” said Tonny Gultom, Harita’s head of health, safety and environment...
The nickel mine on Obira has been operated by Harita since 2016, but in 2018, Lygend joined to plan, design and construct the HPAL refinery, eventually acquiring a majority stake in the project. The processing facility, which was designated a priority for the national government, opened in 2021.
After the companies withdrew their initial plan to dump the HPAL waste into the sea, they told authorities that they would store the waste on land, drying out the acidic slurry before dumping it back into the mining pit, and then treating the residue water in a tailings “pond.”
Only a year earlier, however, Harita executives had published a research article in a science journal stating that land disposal on Obira is actually “less suitable” because the region is in a notoriously active seismic zone — as recently as 2019, a 7.2-magnitude earthquake devastated a port town on Bacan island, less than 50 miles from Obira — and is frequently visited by heavy rainfall. That article also noted that about 7,000 villagers lived downstream from the site, concluding that the construction and water control required for land disposal was “not feasible.”
Asked about those findings, a Harita spokesman acknowledged that storing the waste on land is dangerous but said the company is managing the risks by drying out the slurry and dumping it back into the mining pit, where it is prevented from seeping into local waterways.
But a foreign mining consultant who has been working on projects in Indonesia for more than two decades said: “It’s a massive heap of waste. And if it’s not stored properly, you can have landslides. That’s my biggest concern.” He spoke on the condition of anonymity because of business considerations...
Four international mining experts independently reviewed photos of the mining site at Obira taken by The Washington Post. The experts said that it was impossible without a formal audit to ascertain whether Harita and Lygend were dumping HPAL tailings into the sea, but that there were multiple signs that the companies were generally failing to contain mining waste.
The photos show “devastating” levels of deforestation, which can increase the risks of tailings accidents, said Aimee Boulanger, executive director of the Initiative for Responsible Mining Assurance, an organization that audits mining operations and measures them against social and environmental standards. Even if tailings were not being actively pumped into the sea, there don’t appear to be “any significant controls” over what’s flowing out of the mine and entering waterways, she added.
Sam Riggall, an advocate of responsible mining and the chief executive of Sunrise Energy Metals, an Australian nickel and cobalt mining company, said the material entering the rivers around the mining facility resembled processed waste, rather than just runoff from open-pit mines...
Gultom, Harita’s head of safety, acknowledged that the HPAL refinery was producing a “huge volume” of waste that could pose safety risks if not properly managed, but he stressed that it was being handled with adequate precautions.
The discolored water near Obira’s coast, he said, was caused by sedimentation created by timber mining years ago. “It has nothing,” Gultom said, “to do with us.”
Harita, which debuted on the Jakarta stock exchange in April, plans to add a second processing plant on Obira next year, company executives said.""

""PT PLN (Persero) has succeeded in relocating the Diesel and Gas Power Plant (PLTDG) from Batanghari, South Sumatra to East Halmahera, North Maluku to supply electricity for the Ferronickel Smelter factory owned by PT Aneka Tambang, Tbk (Antam) . This collaboration between State-Owned Enterprises (BUMN) is a form of support for the downstream nickel industry in the country.
Main Director of PLN Darmawan Prasodjo said that PLN will ensure that the electricity supply for the East Halmahera Feronickel Smelter is sufficient for the long term. He considered that the readiness of electricity supply would be the foundation for the nickel mining industry sector to develop quickly.
""In accordance with President Joko Widodo's directives, we absolutely implement this nickel downstream policy. Our task at PLN is to ensure electricity supply to boost the rate of economic growth and to create a multiplier effect through the readiness of electricity supply for industries and businesses,"" said Darmawan.
Darmawan added, the first stage of lighting with a power of 15 mega watts (MW) is a follow-up to the Electricity Purchase Agreement (PJBTL) which was agreed by both parties in March 2022. Then in February 2023 the second stage will be lit with 75 MW of power.
To be able to meet the electricity demand for the first phase of 15 MW, within 9 months PLN succeeded in synchronizing 1 generating machine of 15 MW out of a total of 5 generating machines from South Sumatra of 51 MW and Jambi of 60 MW which were relocated to East Halmahera so as to optimize supply. electricity for PT Antam's smelter.
""In this case we want to support PT Antam all out because as fellow BUMNs, PT Antam is a brother of PLN,"" said Darmawan.
Darmawan said that this collaboration also signifies the synergy between SOEs to boost the national economy. Because, PT Antam is a BUMN Mining Industry Holding that focuses on implementing downstream-based strategic development initiatives. This initiative is very important to increase the added value of mining product commodities.
“If this is the first lighting, then there will be more lighting. And the PT Antam-PLN collaboration will be even closer with better chemistry with one goal, namely to build Indonesia to be more advanced,"" said Darmawan.
Antam's Director of Business Development Dolok Robert Silaban said that this first electricity startup was a very important step for the success of the Ferronickel Smelter construction project in East Halmahera. Currently, his party is concentrating on completing the East Halmahera Ferronickel Plant development project along with its supporting infrastructure.
""On behalf of PT Antam, I appreciate the first power start from PLN. Through positive synergy and strong commitment between PT Antam and PT PLN, PJBTL implementation can be carried out optimally. This is very useful in accelerating the completion of the construction phase of the East Halmahera Ferronickel Plant,"" said Dolok.
Dolok added, In line with the completion of the power plant installation and smelter construction, the East Halmahera Ferronickel Smelter with a capacity of 13,500 Tons of Nickel will add to PT Antam's total annual installed ferronickel production capacity portfolio of a total of 40,500 Tons of Nickel.

""Under the umbrella of BUMN Holding Industri Pertambangan MIND ID, one of its members, PT Aneka Tambang Tbk (Antam), has successfully initiated the East Halmahera Feronickel Plant project. This endeavor reached a significant milestone with the inaugural “first metal tapping” process on September 12, 2023.
The “first metal tapping” marks a pivotal phase in the commissioning of the Haltim Feronickel Plant, following the Electric Smelting Furnace (ESF) switch-on event held on July 19, 2023.
Heri Yusuf, the Secretary of MIND ID, affirmed that Antam’s operation of the Haltim Feronickel Plant has been part of MIND ID’s commitment to support downstream activities in the mining sector. 
“MIND ID will continue to uphold the government’s mandate to become a world-class company by harnessing and utilizing Indonesia’s mineral reserves,” he stated.
Effort to boost Indonesia’s mineral industry
The Haltim Feronickel Plant is a manifestation of Antam’s efforts to bolster the mineral industry in Indonesia and aligns with MIND ID’s commitment to focus on strategic company projects in 2023.
The “first metal tapping” at the Haltim Feronickel Plant is the third stage in the commissioning process, targeted for completion by the end of the third quarter of 2023.
“I Dewa Wirantaya, Director of Business Development at ANTAM, emphasized, “Antam is committed to ensuring the stability and safety of plant operations, including during the commissioning process. With the execution of the first metal tapping process, Antam will commence preparations for commercial production.”
The initial stages of the Haltim Feronickel Plant’s operation began on July 7, 2023, marked by the “burner-on” process, which involves heating the furnace before applying electrical current.
Following the completion of the furnace process, the Haltim Feronickel Plant proceeded with the “switch on furnace” phase, officially launching the nickel smelting plant in conjunction with chromium metal.
In 2020, Antam continued its progress in completing Phase I Line I of the Haltim Feronickel Plant. In addition, Antam also completed the supporting infrastructure for the plant, which had been under construction since 2017.
By December 2020, physical construction progress of the plant had reached an impressive 98.12% completion. Alongside the feronickel processing plant, Antam continued developing supporting infrastructure in 2020, including the expansion of the town site area and other infrastructure in line with established targets and plans.
Located in Halmahera Timur, North Maluku, the Haltim Feronickel Plant is set to have a production capacity of 13,500 Metric Tons of Nickel in Feronickel (TNi).
Upon full operation, it will complement the feronickel production from the Kolaka Feronickel Plant in Southeast Sulawesi, which boasts a capacity of 27,000 TNi. This will bring Antam’s installed portfolio of feronickel production capacity to an impressive 40,500 TNi.
Moreover, the Haltim Feronickel Plant will be equipped with various key production facilities, including a 170-ton-per-hour Rotary Dryer, a 165-ton-per-hour Rotary Kiln, a 60 MW Electric Smelting Furnace, and other supporting production facilities.""

""Residents of Buli, East Halmahera, North Maluku, are voicing the fate of the Wato-Wato mountains and forests which are currently becoming a mining industrial area or area.
Through a press release received by halmaheranesia , Said Marsaoly, a resident of Buli, said that mining activities in East Halmahera had had a negative impact on destroying residents' living spaces, from the mainland to coastal areas and small islands in the vicinity.
""In this area which was previously rich in nutmeg and cloves, there are 27 mining business permits (IUP), with a total concession area of ​​172,901.95 hectares,"" said Said, Wednesday, September 6 2023.
Said said, of the total mining permits, PT Aneka Tambang (ANTAM) is one of the largest concession holding companies that controls the mainland area of ​​Halmahera, down to the small islands of Gee and Pakal.
According to him, apart from PT Antam's operations, now Mount Wato-Wato, which is important for residents, is also being targeted by PT Priven Lestari. On Mount Wato-Wato there are protected forest areas and village forests which function as water catchment areas.
""From the Wato-Wato forest area, there are springs that flow through three large rivers and several tributaries which have been the main source of water for thousands of residents, and have even become a source of raw water for PDAM Buli,"" he said.
Apart from that, at the foot of Mount Wato-Wato there are also residents' agricultural land planted with nutmeg, cloves and pineapples. All of this is the main source of the people's economy.
Now, he said, the government and PT Priven Lestari's efforts to open a mining industry on Mount Wato-Wato have the potential to wipe out the entire source of life for these residents.
""This coercive effort can be seen from the public discussion or consultation process on AMDAL documents from 2015 to 2018 which did not accommodate residents' voices of objection,"" he explained.
He explained that the series of acts of resistance by residents so far has actually been responded to with attempts to criminalize residents who refuse mining.
""This criminalization effort can be seen from the appearance of summons from the police against eleven residents who refused mining in July 2023, on charges of abuse, threats and vandalism,"" he said.
In fact, what the residents are doing is simply defending their last living space, namely Mount Wato-Wato, from the mining industry.He said that based on this situation, the residents of East Halmahera, who had gathered in the Buli Caring Wato-Wato Community Alliance, pressed for several demands.
“Urge the Minister of Energy and Mineral Resources to immediately stop and revoke PT Priven Lestari's mining permit. ""Urge the Minister of Environment and Forestry not to process the application for a Borrow-to-Use Forest Area Permit (IPPKH) for PT Priven Lestari, and to impose strict legal sanctions for its operations that damage forest areas,"" he explained.
Then, they also urged the police to stop the legal process against the residents who reported it, and asked the Regent and DPRD of Haltim, the Governor and DPRD of North Maluku to immediately issue a recommendation to stop operations and revoke PT Priven Lestari's permit to the Minister of Energy and Mineral Resources.
""Urge Komnas HAM to conduct an investigation into alleged human rights violations committed by PT Priven Lestari, the government and the police,"" concluded Said.
Until this news was broadcast, PT Priven Lestari and other parties were trying to confirm the pressure from Buli residents.""

The waste released by the company that has been operating there since 2006, has now covered and polluted the bottom of the coastal area. Anas says that the place where he is now standing, was once teeming with corals, a habitat for fishes and other marine life.
His father, who was a fisherman from Sulawesi and moved to the area under the government’s sponsored transmigration program in the 1980s, often recounted that there used to be so many fishermen working in Moronopo Bay but now no more.
“The mackerels which are commonly consumed by people were a staple. But now their habitat has been destroyed,” Anas said during an interview in mid-May.
The Moronopo Bay is administratively located in Soasangaji village, in the Kota Maba sub-district of East Halmahera, North Maluku. It takes five hours to reach the area from Sofifi, the main town in North Maluku.
The East Halmahera Environment Agency has noted that the waste sedimentation had covered an area of four hectares. At the farthest point from the coastline, about 100 meters from the source of the waste disposal, the waste layer, consisting of mud and rock, rises up to almost one meter from the beach surface.
The company tried to cover the waste by planting mangroves but Anas said it was a failed attempt as the waste continued to flow into the bay and the mangrove could not survive, in contrast to the naturally grown mangroves in the area.
In one corner where mangrove seedlings had just been planted, a board that says “PT Antam Mangrove Planting Conservation” sticks out from the ground. The board also indicates the first mangrove was planted in 2009.
“So, these mangroves were planted in hopes to reduce the impacts of the waste pollution and it has been done several times, but they are still a far cry from the massive scale of their mining activities,” Anas said.
The worsening condition of the Moronopo bay is what prompted local residents to hold a protest on April 7, 2021, demanding that Antam cease all its mining activities. There was no response from the company.
The nickel mining operation on top of the hill in the Moronopo Bay area, is part of a mining concession owned by Antam and will expire in 2040. The concession of some 39,000 hectares, or more than half of the surface of the nation’s capital, Jakarta, straddled two subdistricts – Maba and Kota Maga.
Antam is also mining nickel in Tanjung Buli, Maba subdistrict, since 2001; and in Pakal Island, in Kota Maba subdistrict, since 2011.
In 1998, Antam started mining nickel in Gee Island, Maba. The island has entered rehabilitation phase, although remnants of exploitation of the area remain evident.
In 2012, Antam also built a nickel refinery in Tanjung Buli but this facility is not yet in operation, while the permit will expire in 2032.
The company that was established not long after the establishment of the New Order, has been exploiting mineral in these two subdistricts of East Halmahera for more than two decades.""

(Tandaseru, 4/7/2021, tandaseru.com ): 2 Meters of Mud on the Shoreline, East Halmahera Residents Demonstrate Antam
""A number of residents of East Halmahera Regency , North Maluku Province, staged an action at the Moronopo mining site owned by PT Aneka Tambang, Wednesday (7/4).
This is because local residents think that Antam is not serious about handling mining waste which has caused the nearby coast to be filled with 2 meters of mud.
This action was led by Kapita Sangaji Maba Haltim, Ibrahim Haruna. This action was triggered by public unrest who accused Antam of polluting the environment with its mining waste.
""Because this mining location has practically been active for years, but until now in handling environmental pollution there has been no seriousness from Antam itself,"" said Udin, one of the demonstrators.
The demonstrators also demanded that mining activities in Moronopo be stopped before fixing environmental pollution at that location.
“Environmental problems in Moronopo have been going on for decades. So we, the people who attended, hoped that this would not be considered a trivial matter, because when we dived on the beach the mud was more than 2 meters. It means that this mining location has to be moved, bearing in mind that PT Antam's mining area is large,"" continued Udin.
Meanwhile, Kapita Sangaji, Ibrahim Haruna, in front of members of the East Halmahera DPRD and the company, who at that time also immediately checked the location, said that seeing the waste at the Moronopo mining site which had not been handled so far, the government and DPRD were expected to take steps to deal with the waste that had have piled up on the beach.
""So the government and DPRD are trying to pay attention to this waste, because this is a matter of the needs of the people of Haltim,"" he said.
The demonstrators also promised to continue to oversee the process of improving environmental pollution. If PT Antam does not take this matter seriously, a boycott will be carried out at the mining site.""",1,1,0,0,0,0,Nickel,Nickel smelter,,"https://www.antam.com/uploads/proyek-pengembangan-antam.pdf

IKIP will be located on Sulawesi Cahaya Mineral's IUP (Mining Permit). PT Jcorps Industri Mineral (JIM), which is situated under the holding companies of PT Hamparan Logistik Nusantara, PT Batutua Tembaga Abadi, and PT Merdeka Copper Gold Tbk, owns 32% of PT Indonesia Konawe Industrial Park. The park will be jointly run with Tsingshan.

(Damayanti & Maulia, 3/30/2023, asia.nikkei.com): Merdeka Battery Materials puts $1.28bn price on nickel smelter plan
""Indonesian nickel producer Merdeka Battery Materials, which is affiliated with Chinese battery giant Contemporary Amperex Technology (CATL), on Thursday said a smelter it is planning will cost an initial estimated $1.28 billion and be partly funded by proceeds from its ongoing initial public offering that could raise up to $580 million.
Merdeka Battery, a subsidiary of Merdeka Copper Gold of which CATL is a minority shareholder, is in the bookbuilding process for its IPO through next Tuesday, and is hoping to raise up to 8.745 trillion rupiah ($580 million) from it. Merdeka will release 11 billion shares to the public, representing 10.24% of the company at an offer price of between 780 rupiah and 795 rupiah per share.
The company said it is planning to release an additional 1.1 billion shares in case of oversubscription, meaning it could potentially raise up to 9.62 trillion rupiah, which could make the IPO the second biggest at the Indonesia Stock Exchange so far this year. The IDX debut is slated for April 18.
""We're currently in an early stage to expand to the downstream industry along the EV battery value chain,"" Merdeka Battery President Devin Ridwan said in a written statement on Thursday. ""Through this IPO, [Merdeka Battery] will ensure that our corporate strategic plans will progress maximally.""
Indonesia is the world's biggest nickel producer and holds the largest proven reserves of the metal, a key component in long-range electric vehicle batteries. Companies like Merdeka and other nickel miners hope to ride on the government's push to utilize the country's reserves to develop a battery industry, enter the global EV supply chain and develop a manufacturing base. With a population of more than 270 million, Indonesia also offers a potentially huge market for EVs.
Merdeka Battery earlier this month unveiled a plan to develop its first high-pressure acid leach (HPAL) plant at the Indonesia Konawe Industrial Park, a nickel industrial complex on the southeastern part of Sulawesi island, Indonesia's nickel heartland. The HPAL technology is used to refine Indonesia's low-grade nickel ore into battery-grade materials. The planned facility will have a total capacity of 120,000 tons of nickel equivalent per year.
Merdeka Battery on March 16 signed a memorandum of understanding with Ningbo Brunp Contemporary Amperex, an affiliate of CATL, for the first tranche of the project that will have half of the total planned capacity. The construction is expected to begin this year and the commissioning two years later.
Ridwan told a media briefing on Thursday that the development of the first tranche is estimated to cost $1.28 billion. He added part of the IPO proceeds will be used to finance the project, and some will come from Merdeka Battery's cash flow.
A bigger portion of the IPO proceeds will be used to pay off debts, which Ridwan said will ""strengthen the company's fundamentals and give [us] a flexibility to look for new funding and expand.""
Merdeka Battery is separately partnering with Chinese stainless steel giant Tsingshan Holding to develop the 3,500-hectare Konawe park, for mining operations through joint venture Sulawesi Cahaya Mineral -- said to have one of the world's largest nickel resources -- and for operations of two smelters producing nickel pig irons. NPI has been used mainly as a feedstock for the stainless steel industry, but Merdeka is exploring a plan to convert NPI into nickel matte, a precursor to nickel sulfate used for batteries...""

(Biro Administrasi Perekonomian Sulawesi Tenggara, 6/18/2022, biroekonomi.sultraprov.go.id): ""...After successfully ""conjuring"" the Morosi District into a mega-industrial complex, Regent Kery is now preparing a new industrial area in Routa District. 
The nominal value of investment in the westernmost region of Konawe is said to be greater than that of the mega industry in Morosi. In Routa District, Regent Kery facilitated the entry of PT.Sulawesi Cahaya Mineral (SCM) through the flag of PT.Indonesia Konawe Industrial Park (IKIP) which invested around IDR 58 trillion in capital. Mining activities in Routa are currently underway. PT.IKIP will explore over the mining business permit area (IUP) owned by PT.SCM, which is an area of ​​3,563 hectares. The corporation is currently building an industrial complex with various other supporting infrastructure. 
The presence of investment in Routa is projected to absorb around six to eight thousand workers. It is believed that the absorption of so many workers will alleviate unemployment. Routa, which was previously branded as a marginal area, is now predicted to become a developed area thanks to the influx of investment in the region. 
Konawe Regent Kery Saiful Konggoasa said, through private investment in Routa, nickel factories and other derivatives will be built in that area. This includes nickel derivatives, namely lithium, which is used as a raw material for making electric vehicle batteries. ""We are grateful for the investment in Routa. We need the investment in order to accelerate regional progress. This investment will also help us overcome employment problems in Konawe,"" Regent Kery told Kendari Pos yesterday. 
Meanwhile, Konawe Secretary (Sekab) Konawe Ferdinand Sapan stated, PT.SCM has so far continued to improve the progress of the development of industrial estates in Routa. Including, the acceleration of the production process this year from the initial target in 2024. Ferdinand said, the Konawe Regency Government had also provided support as a form of support for accelerating the development of industrial estates in Routa by PT. SCM. 
""The government's support, one of which is that we accelerate the Routa Detailed Spatial Plan (RDTR). Thus, when corporations build their industrial estates or other supporting areas related to industry, it will have a positive impact on the community. That's why, we have to prepare the RDTR from the start ,"" he explained. 
With that support, said Ferdinand Sapan, PT.SCM will consistently prioritize all the potential that exists in Konawe to support the company's production activities. Whether it's the potential of natural resources (SDA) or human resources (HR). 
The former Head of BPKAD Konawe admitted that on various occasions when he met delegations from PT. SCM, he always asked the corporation to prioritize local potential rather than looking elsewhere. ""One of the things I conveyed to the company, if they need to eat there and still eat from rice, never buy rice from other places. They have to buy rice from Konawe. Later, if Konawe can't afford it, then look elsewhere,"" said Ferdinand Sapa. He said, to further strengthen the commitment between the government and the private sector regarding investment in Routa, the Konawe Regency Government will also make a memorandum of understanding with PT.SCM. For example, the Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) related to the concept of managing Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) funds which is the responsibility of the company. 
""So we use methods like that. The MoU includes the education sector. Later we will try to convey that our human resources need to be pushed or increased in level. So that the company must take a role in it,"" explained Ferdy, the nickname of the Regency Secretary. Konawe it. 
Ferdy continued, industrial activity in Routa by PT. SCM, would certainly open up new jobs in the local authorities. Many Konawe local workers (TKL) can be recruited by the company. Ferdinand Sapan said, the latest report from PT. SCM, 2,500 workers had been recruited to build the mega industrial complex in the westernmost region of Konawe. But the problem going forward, he continued, is when corporations need skilled workers (skills). Meanwhile, the readiness of Konawe's human resources with special skills is still relatively low. ""One of the things we have prepared is the later integration of the need for skilled workers from the Polytechnic in Morosi. And also, later we will build other vocations. We will also try to communicate with other universities. Both in Konawe as well as in the provincial capital,"" concluded Ferdy.

""The AMMAN smelter development project carried out by PT Amman Mineral Industri (AMIN) in the Sekongkang Batu Hijau Area became the largest contributor to investment realization in West Nusa Tenggara (NTB) Province in the 2022 period…
In a press conference held some time ago, the Head of the NTB One-Stop Investment and Integrated Services Service (DPM-PTSP) Muhammad Rum said that the investment target assigned to the NTB Provincial Government for 2023 was even higher, reaching IDR 22 trillion.
""Investment from smelters that AMIN worked on was the biggest contributor from West Sumbawa Regency to the realization of investment in NTB last year, as well as in 2023. Various efforts will be made to achieve the investment realization target, including providing convenience in permitting investors to invest in NTB. Apart from that, we also provide guidance, supervision, and acceleration of realization for investors, especially national strategic projects, one example of which is the smelter,"" explained Rum.
Regarding the contribution of the AMMAN smelter, President Director Rachmat Makkasau said that this achievement illustrates the company's commitment to supporting economic growth.
""This achievement is the result of a joint collaboration where we see enormous support for the construction of smelters, both from the central and regional governments. We really hope that support from the government will continue to be given to us so that the smelter project can continue to run in parallel with our operational business activities, so that other big projects that will increase investment value can be realized. Apart from supporting the NTB Province to achieve its 2023 investment target, this is also in line with the statement from the Coordinating Ministry for the Economy, Mr. Airlangga Hartarto, last Monday, which will continue to encourage the realization of the National Strategic Project (PSN) by resolving obstacles related to licensing for investment,"" said Rahmat.
Looking at the results of last semester's verification, AMIN's smelter has reached 47 percent. This achievement is based on the calculation of the realization of the budget requirements for the smelter, which includes physical construction and also the purchase of equipment and machinery for operations.
The investment value that has been spent is equivalent to US$ 466 million out of a total of US$ 982 million. This shows the company's commitment to continuing the construction of the smelter. However, the constraints of the COVID-19 pandemic and the energy crisis in Europe, which are external factors, have caused logistical and human resource (HR) mobilization constraints, so that the target of completing the smelter in 2023 will not be realized.
The AMMAN smelter is targeted for completion in 2024. Some time ago, AMMAN also held a meeting with the NTB Government to explain the company's operational achievements and business plan in 2023.
On this occasion, the President Director of AMMAN said that the absorption of human resources (HR) for various projects since 2021 had increased to 35%, of which nearly 75% came from NTB.

(Trisnawati, 11/7/2022, voi.id): Construction Of Amman Mineral Smelter In West Sumbawa Is Almost Capai 50 Percent, Targeted By Rampung In 2024
""The metal mineral processing plant (smelter) construction project developed by PT Amman Mineral Nusa Tenggara (AMMAN), until early November 2022 almost reached 50 percent.
The amount of funds that have been disbursed has reached 465 million dollars out of the total investment requirement estimated at US $ 982 million or equivalent to Rp. 14.7 trillion.
Head of Corporate Communications of PT Amman Mineral Nusa Tenggara, Kartika Octaviana said the construction of the smelter was completed in 2024 from the initial projection set by the government in June 2023.
Kartika added, the construction of a smelter in Batu Hijau, West Sumbawa Regency, West Nusa Tenggara, should have been delayed a little from the schedule due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
This creates a number of face-to-face meetings to discuss the specifications of delayed smelter engineering and engineering which will have an impact on the construction work timeline, as well as delays in the negotiation process and financial statement decision.
""As a result, the mobilization of large equipment and equipment that is very important for the construction of smelters, especially from Europe, has been delayed from the initial schedule,"" Kartika said as quoted by Antara, Monday, November 7.
This year, Kartika continued, the challenges are even greater with the Ukraine-Russia conflict affecting the delay in supply chain, in the form of increasing cost of mobilizing goods and humans, lack of containers, to closing ports.
Considering that almost 50 percent of investment has been disbursed, Kartika continued, it is impossible for the mineral mining company, which is affiliated with PT Medco Energi Internasional Tbk, to withdraw from the smelter project.
""This means that we remain committed to completing the construction of the smelter, especially since the funding is also available,"" he said.
The Green Stone smelter project is projected to have a production capacity of 222,000 tons of copper cathode. In addition, the smelter will produce 17.8 tons of gold, 54.7 tons of silver and 830.000 sulfate acid.
AMMAN's Head of Social Impact Priyo Pramono added that the six-month verification achievement always exceeded the target and the construction of the camp was completed in October 2022.
""The smelter construction and supporting facilities have also started since July 2022 with the installation of stake poles, including the installation of special water facilities, in the form of desalized water and dem generalization. The mobilization of contractors to the construction area has also been carried out,"" he said.
Priyo added that the purchase order for the long lead equipment has been executed. Moreover, there has been a signing of an agreement to finance syndicates from banks and companies that have processed recruitment in stages according to the construction stage, in collaboration with the West Sumbawa Regency Government (KSB) and NTB.""

(PT. Suara NTB Press, 8/11/2022, suarantb.com): KSB ""All Out"" Helps Realize Smelter Development
""The Regional Government of West Sumbawa Regency (KSB) is making every effort to help create a smelter or metal mineral smelting industry which is currently in the process of preparing for development. Moreover, in accordance with President Jokowi's directives, that all regional leaders must support the acceleration of investment in their respective regions.
KSB Regent Dr. HW Musyafirin said that the smelter in this area will later trigger a derivative industry that can move the economy even faster. So that in this preparation process, the KSB Regional Government together with the NTB Provincial Government and PT. Amman Mineral Nusa Tenggara (AMNT) actively communicates with the central government so that all processes run smoothly.
He said the location for the smelter construction was in Otak Keris Hamlet, Maluk District, KSB. Maluk District itself has been designated by the central government as a priority industrial area along with 26 other priority industrial areas in Indonesia.
""The Maluk District has been decided to become an industrial area out of 27 priority industrial areas to be built in Indonesia and it is included in the national medium-term development plan for 2020-2024,"" said HW Musyafirin in a special interview with Suara NTB recently.
In order to create an industrial area, including for the construction of a smelter, the Regional Government of KSB has the principle that there should be no obstacles, especially those that come from the government. The government must go all out to provide support.
''So from the start we were with the Regional Leadership Communication Forum, where there were the Chair of the PN, the Chair of the DPRD, the Kajari, the Head of the Police and the Dandim all out to help,'' said the Regent.
He said, PT. AMNT has written a letter to KSB containing a request for facilitation of land acquisition in Otak Keris Hamlet, which incidentally is a village area. Initially the Regional Government of KSB hoped that the Smelter could be built in the coastal area, especially where PT. AMNT already owns around 200 hectares of land.
''However, technically the location did not meet the requirements, so during the trip the Otak Keris area was chosen, even though this is a village area,'' he said.
Otak Keris is included in the plan to establish an industrial area with an area of ​​1,164 hectares. Because it will be used as an industrial zone, land in hamlets with around 60 families is included in the land acquisition priority.
''What was needed at that time was 150 hectares, plus another 20 hectares. So more or less what we have freed is around 170 hectares, and it's all clear . Until the last, around 61 hectares, the settlement was through the courts. It's already inrah, the decision from the Supreme Court has also been passed,''explained the Regent.
Musyafirin admitted that he is very optimistic that this smelter will definitely be realized, especially since his party has moved very far to realize this project. It's just that the Covid-19 pandemic has hampered this program a bit, but in principle this smelter will still be built according to plan.
Currently, in preparation for the construction of a smelter, camps or workers' camps are being built with a total of around 2000 – 3000 camps. An engaged workforce with prioritizing local labour. Even now, the Integrated Team tasked with recruiting workers is currently selecting around 1,200 workers for smelter preparation.
 Regarding the proportion of local workers in the construction of this smelter, the Regional Government of KSB certainly prioritizes local workers and local resources for company needs. Likewise other resources such as building materials and food needs so that PT. AMNT absorbs the maximum from the local community.
“In every meeting with AMNT, we always convey that local resources must be a priority. Local resources such as materials, sand, crushed stone, as well as local materials such as rice, vegetables and others. Including labor resources, it must be prioritized from KSB,"" he said.
The KSB Regent admitted that he had drafted a regional regulation so that it was the responsibility of the company, and all sub-contractors working in KSB to use local human resources of at least 40 percent. Prior to drafting this Perda, a Perbup first appeared which required companies to absorb local workers and other local resources with a minimum amount of 60 percent.
“However, we will make a regional regulation for a minimum of 40 percent of resources. Moreover, the central government has asked that spending on local products be at least 40 percent in the regional budget. We try to comply with regulations,"" he explained.
The Regional Government of KSB has conducted a comparative study in Gresik, East Java to take a close look at the smelter industry there and its derivative industries. The Department of Manpower has been given orders to train local workers to become skilled by inviting the involvement of PT. AMNT. (ris)-""

(Moore, 12/31/2021, im-mining.com): AMMAN copper smelter & precious metal refinery in West Sumbawa set for construction with China’s NFC as main contractor
""After the October 2021 groundbreaking ceremony for PT Freeport Indonesia’s (PTFI) new copper smelter at the Special Economic Zone Java Integrated Industrial and Port Estate (SEZ JIIPE) in Gresik, East Java,  a second new copper smelter project is also progressing as PT Amman Mineral Industri (AMIN) recently finally completed detailed contracts with two major contractors to build AMMAN’s Copper Smelter & Precious Metal Refinery (PMR) projects in West Sumbawa Regency (KSB), West Nusa Tenggara Province (NTB).
This is a big downstream value-add boost for the Batu Hijau open pit copper-gold mine operated by sister company PT Amman Mineral Nusa Tenggara, the second largest copper-gold mine in Indonesia behind PT Freeport Indonesia’s Grasberg. It means that Indonesia will soon have three copper smelters – PT Smelting Gresik, which has been operating as the single in-country smelter since 1996, plus the new PTFI and AMMAN smelters now in-development.
The contracts were signed between AMIN and China Non-Ferrous Metal Industry’s Foreign Engineering and Construction Co Ltd (NFC) as well as PT Pengembangan Industri Logam (PT PIL) in a virtual ceremony on Friday, December 10, 2021. The signing ceremony was witnessed by the Governor of West Nusa Tenggara Province and the Regent of West Sumbawa Regency. AMIN’s President Director, Rachmat Makkasau signed both contracts at AMMAN’s headquarters in Jakarta. In his speech, Makkasau stated that these contracts reiterate AMMAN’s commitment to building the copper smelter & PMR projects according to government regulations.
“I would like to thank all parties who have been very patient and persistent in bringing amicable closure on technical, commercial & financial fronts to produce these contracts, despite immense challenges from the COVID-19 pandemic. This contract will soon be followed up by the mobilisation of all contractors, project management companies, including workforce, equipment, and supplies.

""Friday, July 2, 2021 at the Orchid Meeting Room of the Office of the Governor of West Nusa Tenggara Province, a Preliminary Survey Coordination Meeting was held for the Development of Industrial Areas in West Sumbawa Regency, West Nusa Tenggara Province by the NTB Province Financial and Development Supervisory Agency (BPKP). The meeting was opened by the Regional Secretary of the NTB Province (Mr. Drs. H. Lalu Gita Ariadi, M.Sc.) and was attended by Assistant II of the NTB Provincial Secretariat, the NTB Provincial BPKP Team, West Sumbawa Regency Secretary, and elements of the NTB Provincial Government (Head of the ESDM Service , Head of the Bappenda, Head of the Bureau of Procurement of Goods and Services, Head of the Economics Bureau, Head of the PUPR Office Spatial Planning, Head of the DPMPTSP Investment Sector, Representatives of the NTB Provincial Bappeda and several other invitees).
On this occasion, BPKP said that it had coordinated with all stakeholders in both NTB Province and West Sumbawa Regency regarding the Mining Industry Development Plan (SMELTER) and its derivative industries in West Sumbawa Regency in the framework of a preliminary survey of 13 aspects. From the results of the survey, 4 aspects were obtained which had sufficient evidence, namely; licensing/non-licensing aspects, project preparation aspects, spatial planning aspects and land provision aspects. While the other 9 aspects, namely funding, government guarantees, procurement of goods/services, project development implementation, prioritizing domestic components, supervision and control, project regulations, work creation aspects and aspects of utilization do not yet have strong evidence or supporting data.
It is hoped that the BPKP will be able to obtain updated information from the NTB Provincial Government, West Sumbawa Regency Government and PT. Amman Mineral Nusa Tenggara (PT. AMNT) so that BPKP can carry out a comprehensive and integrated cross-sector supervisory role in overseeing the Development of Industrial Estates in West Sumbawa Regency which can ultimately fulfill development accountability in achieving the RPJMN project targets, the NTB Provincial RPJMD and the President's priority programs.
The current issues of smelter development discussed include:
The issue of land acquisition, where in the 154 hectares of land for smelter construction there is still land that has not been acquired;
Changes to the construction schedule and completion of the smelter construction which was originally planned to be completed in 2022 to 2023;
Change in production capacity from 1.3 MTPA to 0.9 MTPA;
The progress of the smelter development has not been significant.
In response to this problem, the NTB Provincial BAPPEDA represented by the Young Expert Planning Functional (B. Sri Ratna Setiawati, ST, M.Eng.) said that the Industrial Area of ​​West Sumbawa Regency had been listed in the Revised RTRW of NTB Province as a Provincial Strategic Area from the point of view of growth interests economy. In addition, in the Spatial Pattern Plan, both the Revised RTRW for the Province of NTB and the Regional Regulation on the RTRW for West Sumbawa Regency, it is stated that the area of ​​the West Sumbawa Regency Industrial Area is 1,160 Ha, which is divided into several zones, as follows:
The smelter zone and its derivative industries cover an area of ​​850 Ha which has received recommendations for suitability for spatial use from the NTB Provincial Spatial Planning Coordination Team (TKPRD) in 2018. From an area of ​​850 Ha it is divided into smelter zones covering 154 Ha (100% land acquisition has been carried out by PT . AMNT) and smelter-derived industrial zones covering an area of ​​696 Ha (not entirely cleared);
Small and medium industrial zone (IKM) covering an area of ​​310 Ha.
In this case, the NTB Province BAPPEDA has always been cooperative and is willing to provide the data needed by the BPKP regarding the smelter construction plan. The Team for the Acceleration of Smelter Development and Its Derivative Industries, which consists of relevant stakeholders , both from the NTB Provincial Government and the West Sumbawa Regency Government, which has worked based on the NTB Governor's Decree since 2018, has carried out its duties to the fullest at the planning stage. For the implementation phase, there has been a change in the schedule for the completion of the smelter construction, which was originally planned to be completed in 2022, to be postponed to 2023. PT. AMNT explained that this was due to the Covid 19 pandemic, so that the progress of the smelter construction has not yet been significant. Regarding the decrease in production capacity of 1.3 MTPA (million tonnes per annual / million tonnes per year) to 0.9 MTPA, the Head of the ESDM Service explained that this was the authority of the central government.
Closing the event, the Secretary of West Nusa Tenggara Province said that the NTB Provincial Government and West Sumbawa Regency Government must continue to oversee and immediately take care of accelerating the clarity of the status of Industrial Estates in West Sumbawa Regency, West Nusa Tenggara Province and it is hoped that clarity on the status of this industrial area will be obtained before the construction of a smelter and its derivative industries held.""

(Indonesia Business Post, 8/19/2024, indonesiabusinesspost.com): Residents sued for blocking production road in PT IHIP industrial zone
""Land conflicts between residents of Topogaro and Tondo villages in Morowali regency, Central Sulawesi, and PT Indonesia Huabao Industrial Park (PT IHIP) industrial zone heat up with four village residents being sued by a tenant of the industrial zone for blocking its production road.
Four villagers of Morowali, namely Rahman Ladanu, Safaat, Sadam, and Imran, received a summons from the Poso District Court on August 15, 2024 following the lawsuit filed by PT Baoshuo Taman Industri Invesment Group (BTIIG), a tenant in PT IHIP. They have been reported to the Court for blocking the production road within PT IHIP and demanded to compensate a material loss of Rp4.3 billion (US$277,000) following three days of idle production as a result of three days of road blockade in early June 2024.
The villagers bocked the road in the wake of a video footage circulated by Cipto Rustianto, an External Legal Staff of PT IHIP, declaring the disputed road is the legal property of PT IHIP based on the Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) of asset swap with the Regent of Morowali.
The Topogaro farm road, which is now the production road within PT IHIP, long before the existence of a nickel company, was used by the local community as a dirt path.
“It served as the villagers’ access to the Topogaro Cave (cultural site) and coffe and cocoa plantations as well as rice fields,” Wandi, a campaigner for Central Sulawesi Chapter of the Indonesian Environmental Forum (WALHI), said in a statement on Monday, August 19, 2024.
The community’s anger over the unilateral claim of the farm road by the company extended to neighboring Ambunu Village, whose residents have had to detour and take a longer distance to travel as the farm road had converted into company buildings and warehouses.
“Until now, PT IHIP has never shown the MoU on the asset swap agreement. Amid the villagers’ blockade of production road, PT BTIIG has launched seven legal attempts to criminalize the residents, ranging from subpoenas, police summonses, to lawsuits,” Wandi said.
He added that unilateral claim of the farm road possession by the company was not the only atrocity allegedly committed by the company.
“There have been efforts by PT IHIP to silence the community fighting for their rights. There was also forced eviction of 14 hectares of productive oil palm land belonging to 12 families of Ambunu Village on October 17, 2022 without the knowledge of the owners,” Wandi said.
PT BTIIG is a nickel smelter-based management company located within PT IHIP industrial zone. PT IHIP’s share composition consists of Zhensi Indonesia Industrial Park with 51percent, Beijing Shengyue Oriental Invesment Co., Ltd with 10.28 percent, PT Kejayaan Emas Persada 27.45percent, and PT Himalaya Global Investment 11.27 percent, with an investment value of Rp14 trillion rupiah. The 20,000-hectare industrial zone is located in the villages of Wata, Tondo, Ambunu, Topogaro, Upanga, Larebonu and Wosu. The development is part of a pilot zone for high-quality international cooperation under the “One Belt, One Road Initiative.”

(Indonesia Business Post, 7/30/2024, indonesiabusinesspost.com): Local community complains about farm road grab case in Morowali
""A dozen of resident representatives grouped under the United Ambunu Forum of West Bungku District, Morowali Regency, along with activists of the Indonesian Forum for the Environment (WALHI) Central Sulawesi chapter, have complained to the National Human Rights Commission (Komnas HAM) and the Ombudsman over the claim made by a Chinese nickel smelter company on a farm road in the regency.
They went to the Ombudsman’s Central Sulawesi Office on July 25, 2024. On the following day, they went to the office of the Central Sulawesi chapter of Kommnas HAM to file a letter of complaint against a Memorandum of Agreement on asset swaps and other criminal acts allegedly conducted by PT Indonesia Huabao Industrial Park.
“The letter contains chronology of the incidents, history of farm road, coordinate points, the decree by the Morowali regency administration that annuls the MOU on asset swaps and minutes of Morowali regency legislative council hearing,” Wandi, a campaigner for WALHI’s Central Sulawesi chapter, said.
Local community has launched the protest in the last two months. They blocked farm road claimed by PT Indonesia Huabao Industrial Park until the Morowali regency legislative council hearing on July 14, 2024 that failed to reach a settlement agreement. The ensuing annulment by the Morowali regency legislative council on the MoU, however, was apparently ignored by PT Indonesia Huabao Industrial Park, which then established a smelter and nickel ore warehouse on the road.
“We are disappointed because the loss of people’s living space and the fact that the company’s presence impoverishes the people slowly under the pretext that nicklel investment will encourage an increase of people’s welfare,” Ramadhan, chairman of the United Ambunu Forum, said in a statement on Tuesday, July 30, 2024.
The Central Sulawesi chapter of WALHI accuses the Morowali regency administration and the Central Sulawesi provincial administration have ignored the people’s basic rights and prioritized the interest of the company by rolling out red carpet for land grabbing,” Wandi said.
“Therefore, we ask the Komnas HAM to protect the activists and the people living around PT Indonesia Huabao Industrial Park. We also ask the Ombudsman to review the MOU between the Morowali administration and PT Indonesia Huabao Industrial Park on asset swaps and the Central Sulawesi administration to return the farm road ownership back to the people,” he added.""

In fact, the road is the main access for the community to their land, such as coffee, cocoa, and rice fields. The road also leads to a cultural site, Topogaro Cave.
The MoU that the company and the regent made was not known to the public at all, there was no notification or socialization. Suddenly, the farm road had become a company road.
Public access to the gardens is also disrupted due to the activity of heavy equipment passing by every day.
 The unilateral claim also sparked public anger that spread to Ambunu Village, a village around IHIP. On June 15, residents of Ambunu Village also joined the road blockade, right next to the IHIP flyover , where ore, coal, and smelter storage warehouses have been built.
""The road blockade action by residents of Ambunu Village was attended by approximately 500 people spread across three points,"" he said.
The demands of the West Bungku residents are asking the Morowali Government to cancel the MoU. They also want to see the MoU in the hands of the company, but IHIP is reluctant to show the document, instead saying that the document is confidential.
Instead of responding to the demands of the community, said Wandi, IHIP actually issued a warning to the blockade action movers. The first warning was given to four residents of Tondo and Topogaro Villages for the June 11 action. The warning was given to Rahman Ladanu, Wahid/Imran, Hamdan, and Safaat. The four people were also reported to the Central Sulawesi Regional Police.
Not only that, said Wandi, IHIP also made a second warning to five residents of Ambunu Village for the blockade and barricading actions that resulted in the company's activities stopping on June 15. These five people are Moh Haris Rabbie, Makmur Ms, Abd Ramdhan, Hasrun, and Rifiana MS.
""So, there were 9 people summoned by IHIP, four were reported to the Central Sulawesi Regional Police.""
The Morowali government finally canceled the MoU. The decision was taken at a meeting between the community, the company, and the Morowali government, along with Forkopimda elements, on June 22.
The company remains adamant that the MoU is still valid because the cancellation was unilateral.
However, Wandi said, the cancellation of the MoU still confused residents. Because, based on the official release of IHIP and the Morowali Regional Government, the MoU was signed on December 22, 2023.
In the minutes of the cancellation of the MoU received by the public, the MoU that was cancelled refers to the MoU dated March 11, 2024.
""Both MoUs use the phrase 'use of assets' while in the widely circulated video the MoU read by IHIP's external legal team uses the phrase 'exchange assets'. Are there any other MoUs?"" he asked.
Rifiana MS, a resident of Ambunu Village who attended the company's summons, said that the Morowali Government seemed to be playing around with the community's demands because it seemed to be taking sides and protecting the company's interests.
He said, the Morowali Government wanted to try to stop their movement, without a clear agreement.
The reconciliation efforts mediated by the Morowali Government did not find a bright spot, instead the debate became more massive. The unilateral claims explained by the Morowali Regional Government could not answer the demands of the community. The Morowali Government, he said, continued to insist on stopping the road blockade movement.
""We were asked to stop our action, however, we still refused and continued the action with the demand to cancel the MoU,"" said Rifiana in a press conference at the end of June.
In addition to canceling the MoU, he said, residents asked for the road status to be handed over to the community. They also questioned the procedures of the Morowali Government to dare to hand over the road to IHIP.
""If our demands are not heeded by the Morowali Government, we will blockade the farm road again. We believe that the farm road belongs to the community, not the company.""
 Cipto Rustianto, External Manager of IHIP denied all accusations from the public. The company, he said, is the result of coordination and approval from the central and regional governments, in accordance with applicable regulations. He claims that he has never encroached on people's farm roads, and is ready to prove it with data and facts.
Cipto also denied criminalizing citizens. He said the accusation of criminalization was baseless. So far, they have been committed to protecting the interests of the community in economic activities according to applicable laws. The company, he said, is trying to embrace the community through village governments and related institutions. ""Therefore, I invite all parties to respect the ongoing legal process and hand over the handling to the competent authorities,"" said Cipto as quoted in Media Alkhairaat .
IHIP is an Indonesian company with Chinese capital. The stock composition consists of Zhensi Indonesia Industrial Park 51%, Beijing Shengyue Oriental Investment Co., Ltd 10.28%, PT Kejayaan Emas Persada 27.45%, and PT Himalaya Global Investment 11.27%...
In Indonesia, the parent company of Zhensi Holding Group to build the IHIP area is PT Bahosua Taman Industri Investment Grup (BTIIG). This industrial area is located in seven villages in Morowali Regency, namely; Topogaro Village, Wata, Ambunu, Tondo, Umpanga, Larobenu, and Wosu. This Rp14 trillion investment project will be built on an area of ​​around 20,000 hectares.
IHIP and BTIIG will build this industrial area with a two-stage scheme. First , build 1,200 hectares in Ambunu, Topogaro, and Tondo which are currently problematic because the claim for the farm road was made unilaterally. Second , build 18,800 hectares in five other villages…
Covert land grabbing
The project, which is claimed to be part of the energy transition work, is actually eroding the surrounding community. Land and roads that are the main access for people to farm and earn a living are seized in various ways and trigger agrarian conflicts.
Yusman, Walhi Sulteng Campaigner said, what happened in Ambunu Village, Topogaro, and Tondo was not the first agrarian conflict. In Morowali, it has been massive since the nickel company took root exploiting natural resources. The modes of land grabbing are also varied, including IHIP smoothing their project in extracting the earth's contents, one of which is the wrong eviction mode. IHIP once took 14 hectares of productive oil palm land from Ambunu residents with the wrong eviction mode at night on October 17, 2022.
When the community protested, Yusman said, the company immediately offered compensation. This condition left farmers with no other choice but to accept compensation. In 2020, he said, IHIP was also suspected of filling in irrigation channels for mining roads that affected 170 hectares of rice fields belonging to 20 families.
The filling of the irrigation channels caused the rice fields to no longer be productive. The company took advantage of the moment to immediately negotiate by offering to buy the community's rice fields. Currently, he said, of the 170 hectares of community rice fields, only 10 hectares are still being managed.
""The filling of the irrigation channel changed the river channel and 36 hectares of community rice fields were submerged in water,"" said Yusma.
Not only that. The IHIP reclamation to build a special jetty terminal covering 40 hectares in Tondo and Ambunu Villages has caused 115 seaweed fishermen to lose their livelihoods. In fact, he said, the reclamation did not have a permit and had been sealed by the Directorate General of PSDKP for violating Law 32/2009.
In addition, there is an allegation that IHIP does not have an industrial area business permit (IUKI) and an environmental permit (amdalalin). In fact, the company has currently built three captive PLTUs with a capacity of 350 MW, a smelter stockpile ore there.
Yusman urged that the MoU for the exchange of farm road assets in Topogaro and Ambunu Villages be completely cancelled. He also asked the company to stop criminalizing four Topogaro and Tondo residents. He also urged the Morowali DPRD to take action on the unilateral claim of the IHIP farm road through the MoU. The relevant ministry, he said, must also evaluate and provide a moratorium on the IHIP because the development of the nickel industry does not have a permit for the area and environment, as well as examine the Acting Regent of Morowali.
“Stop the practice of covert land grabbing and ask the government for supervision.”""

(Teraskabar, 1/9/2024, teraskabar.id): Residents worried about BTIIG Morowali PLTU SUTET stretching across densely populated settlements
""The Industrial Area Community Movement (GMKI) invites all Morowali people, community leaders, youth leaders and groups to voice their joint demands against PT. Indonesia Huabao Industrial Park (  PT. IHIP ) or PT. Bahosuo Taman Industri Investment Group (  PT. BTIIG ) in Bungku Barat District, Morowali Regency, Central Sulawesi.
The demands voiced related to the construction of the Steam Power Plant (PLTU) where the Sutet poles and cables cross through densely populated residential areas. Including the impact of pollution that will be caused later after the PLTU has been operating. Because, there are several villages that are directly affected, namely Topogaro Village, Ambunu Village, Tondo Village, and Wata Village.
Therefore, GMKI held a meeting in Wata Village on Saturday (6/1/2024), discussing the possible impacts that will be borne by residents in the industrial area after the operation of the PLTU along with the construction and stretching of SUTET cables that cross densely populated settlements.
The results of the meeting were then agreed upon by a number of representatives of residents who were present, then the points of agreement were read out by Wajir Muhaimin as the chairman of GMKI Morowali Regency.
The 11 points of demands read out by Wajir were:
1. Construction of PLTU location without socialization of Environmental Impact Analysis (Amdal)
2. Illegal mining without a permit
3. Land grabbing of local residents
4. Land compensation that has not been completed
5. Destruction of community facilities of fishermen without compensation.
6. Termination of Employment Contracts and unilateral termination of employment (PHK) for local residents
7. Closing space for local companies
8. There is no good planning from the company regarding the spatial planning of the company's environment with residential areas and the distance between residents.
9. The PLTU high-voltage power cables pass above residents' houses
10. There are bad activities from companies crowding foreign citizens with fellow Chinese
11. Meanwhile, Indonesian citizens (WNI) are stepchildren.
The 11 points of demands were then increased by 6 points, becoming seventeen points based on the aspirations of the residents' representatives who attended the meeting.
The points in question are,
1. There is no clarity regarding compensation for affected communities.
2. Immediately relocate and resolve the issue of compensation for residents' houses crossed by the PLTU cables and high-voltage power lines.
3. Compensation and relocation of people's homes close to the PLTU due to radiation hazards is mandatory
4. The companies PT. IHIP and PT. BTIIG are suspected of not accepting local residents as security employees, as if they wanted to pit locals against people from outside the region, when this investment should be guarded by local people.
5. Urge PT. IHIP or PT. BTIIG to show the national Traffic Impact Analysis permit
6. PT. IHIP or PT. BTIIG will immediately compensate the seaweed farmers of Pebotoa Village.
In the meeting, it was also revealed that the reason why residents calling themselves GMKI Morowali held a meeting was because PT IHIP or PT BTIIG was building a PLTU but had never socialized its AMDAL to residents in the industrial area.
""PT. IHIP or PT. BTIIG today is building a PLTU and has never conducted socialization regarding environmental impact analysis, the question is why Pebotoa village can receive impact compensation but has never been socialized,"" he said.
Therefore, GMKI held a meeting to try to minimize arbitrary actions by companies so that they do not continue to occur against residents around the mining area.
Wajir continued, for the initial target, his party will immediately block PT. BTIIG's access to the Play Offair and give a speech in front of the PT. IHIP or PT. BTIIG company office.
In the same place, as a member of Ambunu Village, Ahmad hopes that GMKI will truly fight for the aspirations of the people in the industrial circle, not merely for personal interests. ""Then if we look for mistakes and problems with the presence of PT  . IHIP , we don't need to look for them, they are all already in our own heads,"" he said.
Ahmad, said that regarding the issue of licensing, the company must first socialize the AMDAL to the local community, starting from the village level, sub-district level and district level…""

Worker's rights dispute:
Worked killed while processing nickel ore at IHIP from hot calcine dust.
(Mongabay, 8/24/2024, mongabay.co.id): Another Death, Why Do Work Accidents in Nickel Factories Keep Repeating?
""- Workers or laborers experience work accidents in factories in the nickel industrial area in Central Sulawesi, continuously recurring. This time, workers of PT Indonesia Huabao Industrial Park (IHIP) or PT Baoshuo Taman Industri Investment Group (BTIIG) experienced a work accident while processing nickel ore, August 18 in Morowali Regency, Central Sulawesi. One worker died. The temporary suspicion is that this incident occurred due to hot calcine dust from the disposal.
- Henry Foord Jebs, Chairman of the Morowali Mining and Energy Industry Workers Union (SBIPE), regretted the minimal accountability of the company in accidents, including last year's major explosion. The company should have been audited by an independent team involving the labor union.
- Trend Asia notes that from 2015-2023, there were 93 work accidents at nickel smelters in Indonesia. ITSS, the highest contributor to worker deaths, was involved in the explosion incident in December 2023 that resulted in 21 deaths and 30 injuries.
- In line with research from China Labor Watch (CLW) published on December 22, 2023. The report investigated the nickel production plan by delving into labor practices at Indonesia's largest nickel production industry project backed by Chinese capital. The report said that for almost a decade, horrific workplace deaths have continued to occur in the nickel industry in Indonesia. Substandard safety practices are the main cause of a series of accidents and deaths in the workplace.""",1,1,0,0,0,0,Nickel,Nickel,Nanjing Hanrui Cobalt ,"https://www.gem.wiki/PT_IHIP_power_station
