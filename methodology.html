        <h2>Methodology</h2>
        <p><i>Note: The dataset was updated October 10, 2024 with corrections, archived links, and the addition of Indonesia Huabao Industrial Park. For detailed information on dataset updates, please refer to our <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1JZlqpgZOxILJFm7U8k_yU-aBG0wD-Xss1l0wrwDJ7ts/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">Changelog</a>.</i></p>
        Our data collection effort began in October 2022. We first compiled a list of industrial parks and basic information from the Indonesian Ministry of Industry’s list of kawasan industri and the EU-Indonesia
            Business Network Industrial Estate Directory. Overtime, we added industrial parks that we learned of through
            other sources, such as the Batam 2022 Industrial Estate Book or news articles. For each industrial park
            included in our dataset, at least one source classified the location as an industrial park, industrial
            estate, kawasan industri, or related status, such as a KEK. Our dataset is not a comprehensive list of all
            industrial parks in Indonesia; we limited our initial dataset to 140 industrial parks to focus on data
            collection across all of our fields of interest. In the future, we hope to expand the dataset to include
            additional industrial parks currently excluded from our dataset.</p>
        <p>After we compiled our initial list of industrial parks and basic information on each park, we focused on
            adding more detailed information and sources for specific groups of fields, including operational status,
            main industry, disputes, and electricity source and capacity. Some of these focus areas, such as electricity
            source and dispute type, contain non mutually exclusive categorical data. These field groups have been
            represented as a series of dummy columns (1 for occurrence, 0 for non occurrence) with associated notes
            columns to present details and sources for our findings. To document our sources, we have quoted relevant
            paragraphs from sources in notes columns, with the links for all sources located in the “Sources” column.
        </p>
        <p>The table below provides a description of the data collection process for each group of fields. Additional
            information regarding the meaning of different field values (“Status” and “Disputes” values) is included in
            the Results section.</p>

                    using Google Maps and use Google Maps’ address formatting, minus the Geocode. Latitude and longitude
                    coordinates are also reported from Google Maps. For industrial parks where we could not verify the
                    exact location, further information on the approximate location reported is provided in “Location
                    Notes”. Region, compiled based on province, follows Indonesia’s geographical unit divisions (ISO -

                    and Gas Plant datasets and wiki. We include excerpts from reports and news articles used to
                    establish an industrial park’s electricity sources or capacity in the Electricity Capacity Notes
                    column. Electricity capacity is reported in megawatts (MW). For sources that report electricity
                    capacity in other units, a capacity factor of 1 is assumed for conversions to MW. If sources cite
                    different electricity capacities for one industrial park, we conservatively use the lowest, most
                    commonly reported electricity capacity. Many industrial parks only have data on electricity
                    providers, not electricity capacity, especially for industrial parks that source from PLN.

                    subsidiary of a larger company headquartered in another country. “Foreign Tenants” lists the
                    nationalities of foreign companies that are tenants at the industrial park. We only assessed tenant
                    company nationality for large tenant companies or industrial parks with few tenants. For industrial
                    parks with many tenants, this column is likely missing data. Details regarding the specific foreign

                    We report operational status based on company websites, Google Maps, and news articles. On Google
                    Maps, we checked the industrial park location for the presence of tenant companies and reviews
                    indicating the status of the industrial park. For parks with the status of “Stalled” or “Unclear,”
                    we viewed Sentinel Imagery to scan for evidence of construction or buildings at the site during June
                    - August 2023. The status of “Before Construction” indicates that the industrial park is planned,
                    but construction has not yet started. A status of “Stalled” indicates that an industrial park was
                    planned or at one point under construction, but reportedly failed to progress. A status of “Unclear”
                    means that while the government or other sources claim that an industrial park exists, we could not
                    find evidence to determine the industrial park’s status.

                    Main Industry was determined primarily through an industrial park’s website, company materials, or
                    the tenant companies located at an industrial park. As a measure of intercoder reliability, two
                    researchers independently categorized each industrial park based on previously collected information
                    on the industrial park’s status and tenants. For industrial parks where the categorizations
                    differed, additional information was examined to determine the final categorization. “Main Industry
                    Notes” includes notes of tenant company industries, company materials, or other evidence used to
                    establish an industrial park’s industry categorization.
