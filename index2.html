Tunas Batam Center Industrial Estate includes Tunas 1 Industrial Estate, Tunas 2 Industrial Estate, and Tunas Industrial Estate Bizpark.\n\n(Tunas Group, 2023, tunasindustrial.com): TUNAS BATAM CENTER INDUSTRIAL ESTATE\n\"In 2000, PT Tritunas Bangun Perkasa established the first phase of the Tunas Batam Industrial Estate project, namely Tunas 1, to meet the need for industrial manufacturing buildings in Batam. There are 85 high quality building units that meet the standards of industrial manufacturing needs at Tunas 1 Industrial. Dozens of tenants from various national and multi-national companies chose Tunas 1 Industrial as the best place for their business operations and development.\nAs Batam's economy has grown very rapidly in recent years, this has led to an increase in demand for new industrial land in Batam. Therefore, in March 2012 PT Tritunas Bangun Perkasa continued the construction of the Tunas Batam Center Industrial Estate to the second phase of the project, namely Tunas 2 Industrial.\nAlso followed in May 2012, we built Tunas Bizpark as a business area connected to Tunas 1 and Tunas 2 Industrial. Now, Tunas Batam Center Industrial Estate has become a complete integrated commercial and industrial area with a total land area of 64 hectares.\"",

In 2020, it was reported that development of an oil refinery at the industrial estate had been stalled since 2012.\n\n(Ciptaning, 8/2/2020, trenasia.com): \"The Coordinating Ministry (Kemenko) for the Economy asked Sinopec Group to immediately realize the construction of an oil depot which has been stalled for 8 years in Batam, Riau Archipelago.\n\"Sinomart KTS Development Ltd or a subsidiary of Sinopec and PT Batam Sentralindo have agreed to continue the investment plan for the construction of an oil depot in Batam,\" said Secretary of the Coordinating Ministry for Economic Affairs Susiwijono in Jakarta, Saturday, August 1 2020.\nThe agreement, said Susi, had been contained in a memorandum of understanding (MoU) signed by both parties on July 29, 2020. On this occasion, his party was also present as a witness as well as a form of escort for the realization of the oil depot project.\n\"The Coordinating Ministry for the Economy and BP Batam acted as mediators for the two companies. We will continue to oversee the preparation process until the physical construction so that it can be carried out immediately,\" he added.\n\n(Noviardi, 6/17/2020, trenasia.com): \"We have developed WMIP industrial estate with its strategic and geographic advantages in Batam. Some 75 hectares in WMIP have already been leased by Sinopec Group for the development of oil storage terminal with capacity of 2,6 million m3, explained Paulus Khierawan, Senior Manager at PT. Batam Sentralindo in Batam, June 14, 2020.\nPaulus explained, the location of WMIP industrial estate is approximately 4,8 km from the Strait of Malacca with sea depth of 23 – 25 metres. Due to its competitive advantages, WMIP can accommodate 300,000-DWT VLCC – Very Large Crude Carrier. In line with the company’s Industrial Estate Business License (IUKI), the integrated industrial park can be developed up to 320 hectares.\nThere are 245 hectares of land area currently in preparation at WMIP which are suitable for the development of oil refinery and its downstream integration such as petrochemicals, and even methanol plants which utilize natural gas as feedstock from the nearby Natuna Islands. As developer, we welcome oil and gas investors to Batam which also has its incentives with its Free Trade and Free Port Zone (FTZ) status,” Paulus explained.\"",

Pupuk Kujang's land holdings.\n\n(Bisnic.com, 8/13/2023, bandung.bisnis.com): Catalyst Factory Construction Progress at KIKC Entering the Completion Stage\n\"The progress of building a catalyst factory made by the nation's children located in the Kujang Cikampek Industrial Area (KIKC) is starting to enter the final stage. The construction of this factory was initiated by PT Katalis Sinergi Indonesia (KSI). PT KSI itself is a real manifestation of synergy between state-owned companies, educational institutions and scientists. This company is a consortium, namely between PT Pupuk Kujang which has joined with PT Research and Technology Center (RTC) and the Catalysis Engineering Center of the Bandung Institute of Technology (ITB). \"Currently, construction of the Catalyst factory is in the completion stage,\" said VP of Corporate Communications M Arief Rachman in his statement, Friday (18/8/2023). As is known, he said, the company will later focus on producing catalysts to make green fuel or environmentally friendly fuel. As for Pupuk Kujang Cikampek itself, as a petrochemical company, it also contributed to this.\nArief said that a catalyst is a substance that can speed up and direct chemical reactions when converting a raw material into another desired material.  \"A catalyst is very necessary to speed up the reaction in the process of converting palm oil or castor oil into biofuel (BBN),\" he said.\nIn the future, this biofuel is projected to be widely used. This is because fossil fuel oil will increasingly run out because it cannot be renewed. With catalysts, Indonesia can reduce the use of fossil fuels in everyday life. In the transportation sector, the use of fossil-based fuels is slowly being shifted and shifted to electrical energy and biofuels (BBN). To make BBN, a number of technologies are prepared including important materials such as catalysts.   \"So far, the use of catalysts in Indonesia still depends on imports. KSI products can later be used as import substitutes which will save the country's foreign exchange,\" said Arief. At ITB, one example of a product is a catalyst for converting palm oil into vegetable diesel (green diesel) or vegetable gasoline (green gasoline/bio gasoline) and which converts palm kernel oil into vegetable avtur (green avtur/bio avtur) all three of which are in the form of extrudates . The plan is that PT Katalis Sinergi Indonesia will produce a hydrotreating catalyst as an important ingredient in making biofuel which converts palm oil into diesel oil (D100). Apart from that, PT KSI can also make oleochemical catalysts for various industries. Meanwhile, some time ago the President Director of PT KSI Achmad Setiawan explained that this catalyst factory has a production capacity of 800 tons per year. This company is projected to be able to make 7 types of catalyst products. Namely 4 types of hydrotreating catalysts and 3 types of oleochemical catalysts.  This production is expected to be able to meet domestic catalyst needs. As a result, dependence on imported catalysts could be eroded. So, Indonesia does not need to import almost all of its catalyst needs. \"By establishing this factory, we are striving for independence so that we are not dependent on foreign nations. We are proving that Indonesia is capable of making its own catalyst,\" said Achmad some time ago. According to Achmad, the construction of this catalyst factory opens up opportunities for Indonesia to become independent in process technology and industrial resilience. The factory stands on 2 hectares of land at KIKC. (K60)\"\n\n(Pupuk Kujang, 2023, pupuk-kujang.co.id): Subsidiaries & Affiliates\n\"...5.

It is predicted that the presence of Rolling Hills will help advance the economic center in Jakarta's East Corridor.\n\"The property industry in the East Jakarta Corridor is now being enlivened by the quality and beautiful modern Rolling Hills residential area in South West Karawang,\" said PT KJIE Advisor, Poernomo, in a written statement, Sunday (2/8/2020).\nAccording to him, the presence of Rolling Hills is also to create jobs, where the unemployment rate is high due to the current impact of Covid-19.\nTo ensure its commitment to presence, KJIE opened the Rolling Hills Marketing Gallery, last Monday (27/7/2020).\nWe are presenting quality, beautiful housing units with a beautiful environment in Karawang as one of the new economic centers in the East Jakarta Corridor,\" he said.\nRolling Hills guarantees the architectural quality of its units, because they are the creations of world-class architect Alex Bayu.\n\"We want to ensure that Rolling Hills develops Karawang with a more international feel by creating more beautiful housing, to increase the attractiveness of this area as a prospective economic center in Jakarta's East Corridor,\" he said.\nSunrise East Jakarta Corridor\nPoernomo said, Rolling Hills is actually located in the sunrise position of Jakarta's East Corridor, having the best access right at the edge of the West Karawang Toll Gate on the Jakarta-Cikampek Toll Road.\nThis strategic location is supported by very beautiful hilly land contours, thus adding to the beauty of the architecture.\nIn this housing complex, malls, hospitals, schools and other economic and social facilities will also be developed which are needed not only by residents, but also by local residents.\nThe price per house unit is really in accordance with the architectural conditions, supported by an environment with complete facilities, namely IDR 499 million.\n\"We hope that all development processes run smoothly according to the expectations of the government and the community, which seems very business friendly and pro investment, because it also has an impact on job creation and various other multiplier effects on the local economy,\" he concluded.\"",

This is a commitment from the vision of the Cikembar industrial area to present an industrial area that is environmentally friendly, comfortable and open to the surrounding community.\nThe industrial area developed by PT Bogorindo Cemerlang stands on a 220 hectare land in the Cikembar area. In the first stage of development, the Cikembar industrial area is marketing commercial buildings and industrial plots that can be adapted to the needs of entrepreneurs...\nAccording to Irma, the marketing gallery is also equipped with a cullinary area facility with Cappadocia nuances which is the right choice for hanging out with a cozy and Instagrammable atmosphere as well as being a strategic meeting point in Cikembar District.\n\"This event began with praying together, cutting the ribbon, and remarks from the Director of PT Bogorindo Cemerlang, Au Bintoro who is also the Founder of the Olympic Group. Then the event continued with the ceremonial release of 64 balloons consisting of 32 gold balloons and 32 green balloons.

In fact, more than half of the KIT area is targeted to be completed in 2024.\nThis was conveyed by the Director General of International Industrial Access Resilience and Development (KPAII), Ministry of Industry of the Republic of Indonesia, Doddy Widodo during a visit to KIT Ketanggan Village, Gringsing District, Batang Regency, Friday (24/7/2020). With the construction of KIT Batang, he said, it will become a magnet to attract investors, both from within and outside the country.\n\"Around 108 to 2,027 hectares will be built by 2024. Not only as an attraction, but as a supply in the northern corridor between Serang, Banten, and Banyuwangi, East Java,\" explained Doddy.\nHe added that the Ministry of Industry supports the KIT Batang concept which will be integrated with worker housing, education, health services and an inter-factory supply chain. Apart from that, the existence of KIT Batang is a solution to investors' complaints regarding land prices and supporting facilities.\n\"The main complaint from investors is that land prices have fluctuated greatly after it was designated as an industrial area. \"But at KIT Batang, the land prices and facilities are more competitive and able to compete with industrial areas (in) China,\" he said.\nMeanwhile, the Regent of Batang, Wihaji, said that currently in Indonesia there are around 118 industrial areas, and KIT Batang is the 119th industrial area. According to him, the existence of KIT Batang is like a flower ready to be visited by bees that will produce honey. The Regent hopes for support from various ministries with their regulations, to make KIT Batang a driver of community economic growth.\n\"Accelerate the presence of investors, (so that) when there is investment, and there is labor, there is a circulation of money, this will have an impact on economic growth,\" he said.\"\n\n(Grand Batang City, n.d, grandbatangcity.co.id): \"Phase 1: Basic Infrastructure (Estate Road, Road Light, Road Drainage) Complete.

Only 6.5 hectares of land have been utilized; efforts to attract larger investors appear to have stalled.\n\n(Harian Jogja, 6/3/2021, jogjapolitan.harianjogja.com): Piyungan Industrial Area Sluggish, Bantul Regent Reprimands Management\n\"The Bantul Regency Government has reprimanded the manager of the Piyungan Industrial Area (KIP), PT Yogyakarta Isti Pratama (YIP) following the lack of significant progress in developing the area. The warning was issued some time ago as an effort by the Bantul Regency Government to accelerate the development of KIP.\n“I give a warning to PT YIP. Why is there no progress? \"He said he was able to bring in investors,\" said Bantul Regent Abdul Halim Muslih, Thursday (3/6/2021).\nHalim revealed that the aim of the warning given by the Bantul Regency Government to PT YIP was to accelerate development and development to attract more investors to KIP.\nBecause, during the six years of managing KIP, PT YIP, which has authority over 85 hectares of land in the area, has only used 6.5 hectares.\nTherefore, the District Government is worried that the remaining 14 year lease owned by PT YIP will not be optimal and will have an impact on economic growth in Bantul.\n\"\"I am worried that this will affect the interest of potential investors, because the lease period is only 14 years.\nThe district government itself is committed to budgeting for and building road access to the industrial location,\" he explained.\nHalim further revealed that the Regency Government had budgeted IDR 39 billion for land acquisition and construction of infrastructure for entry and exit access to KIP. Apart from that, the District Government has an interest in KIP as an effort to absorb labor, economic growth, community partnerships and poverty alleviation.\n\"So the faster it develops, the faster KIP will have a positive impact on other sectors,\" said Halim.\nSeparately, the Head of the Bantul Cooperatives, UMKM and Industry Service, Agus Sulistyana, said that PT YIP had made industrial zones at KIP. However, until now not all of the land has been used. Meanwhile, the district government is also preparing another industrial area, namely in Sedayu. In fact, currently there are several investors who are interested in entering.\n\"The direction for Sedayu is that it can be managed by the district government itself,\" he said.\"\n\n(Pemerintah Daerah Daerah Isitimewah Yogyakarta, 2/21/2018, jogajaprov.go.id): Piyungan Creative Economy Industrial Zone Helps DIY Economic Growth\n\"Around 335 hectares of land in the Piyungan Creative Economy Industrial Zone is ready to help the economic growth of the Special Region of Yogyakarta. A total of 524,395 MSMEs in DIY are expected to dominate the percentage of 98.4% of economic growth in DIY.\nThis statement is the result of discussions between the Governor of DIY Sri Sultan HB Kepatihan Complex, Yogyakarta, Wednesday (21/02) morning.\nAssistant for the Economy and Development of the DIY Regional Secretariat, Drs. Budi Wibowo, MSi. stated that in the future the Piyungan Creative Economy Industrial Zone will be oriented towards Small and Medium Enterprises (UKM) such as fashion , culinary, crafts, animation, handicrafts , music, photography , games and the digital industry.\n\"Creative industry is our current concentration in DIY to focus on working on the Piyungan Creative Economy Industrial Zone and later we will continue with the Sentolo Creative Economy Industrial Zone,\" said Drs. Budi Wibowo, MSi.\nDIY Governor Sri Sultan HB\n\"I appeal to SMEs that the production process does not have to be done on site, it can be processed at home and then the results can be exhibited at that location,\" added Sri Sultan HB\nDrs. Budi Wibowo, MSi. added, in the process of developing the Piyungan Industrial Area there are several requirements that must be completed immediately, such as the Yogyakarta Governor's Decree which still needs to be revised and the industrial area business permit for direct construction.\n\"Here we want to provide easy investment for investors and the plan is that on March 12 2018 it will be ready to operate. \"The hope is that the Piyungan Creative Economy Industrial Area can become Indonesia's Silicon Valley , because the Human Development Index (HDI) in DIY is number two in Indonesia, which means that DIY's human resources are extraordinary,\" said the Assistant for Economy and Development of the Regional Secretariat of DIY.

Guritno said that the government is targeting foreign investment in JIIPE to reach US$16 billion or around Rp. 250 trillion. \"So far, since it was designated as a KEK, investment entering JIIPE has reached around IDR 52 trillion and will continue to increase along with regional development,\" he explained in a press release, Friday (10/11/2023).\nAgung is optimistic that the targets set by the government will be met because of the various facilities provided by the government and industrial areas, especially connectivity between areas around Gresik and with the port. Achieving the target begins with the inclusion of mining product processing facilities or known as smelters owned by PT Freeport Indonesia, which is one of the leading industries in JIIPE. As part of the government's industrial downstream program, Freeport became JIIPE's anchor tenant with an area of ​​100 hectares.  As of the end of August 2023, the directors of PT Freeport Indonesia told the media that construction of the factory had reached 76%. Freeport is rushing to fulfill President Joko Widodo's request that this factory be operational by May 2024. The Freeport smelter factory, which was built with an investment of US$ 3 billion, is one of 21 companies that have joined JIIPE. Since JIIPE was confirmed as a special economic zone, five large tenants have joined and it is hoped that this will stimulate further interest from foreign investors to invest in the Gresik KEK. Built in 2012, the JIIPE Industrial Area was officially designated as a KEK through Government Regulation (PP) No. 71 of 2021 dated 28 June 2021 concerning the Gresik Special Economic Zone, with business activities consisting of production and processing; logistics and distribution; research, digital economy, technology development; and energy development supported by industry 4.0. This area, with a total area of ​​3,000 hectares, consists of the development of an industrial area of ​​1,761 hectares and a port area of ​​406 hectares, where both areas are SEZs supported by a residential area of ​​800 hectares. With various clusters, namely metal, electronic, chemical, energy, support and export-oriented logistics , the area integrated with the deep sea port has multipurpose dock facilities covering an area of ​​500X50 meters, with a pier length of 1,000 m and supported by a sea depth of up to -14 LWS, JIIPE port has the capacity to accommodate ships up to 100,000 DWT. The JIIPE area is not only integrated with the port, but also has toll access, namely the Surabaya-Manyar Toll Road and the Krian-Legundi-Bunder-Manyar (KLBM) Toll Road which are currently in the completion stage of the Bunder-Manyar section, which will later be integrated with the KLBM Toll Road section. Trans Java and has direct access from the area. \"The distance from JIIPE to the Surabaya-Manyar toll gate is only three kilometers which is connected to the provincial road known as Jalan Daendels,\" said PT BKMS HR and Logistics Director Agung P. Guritno, at the end of last October. The district and provincial governments have completed part of the widening of the provincial road which is one of the access points to JIIPE. \"Only access to the Bunder-Manyar Toll Road is still in the completion stage,\" added Agung. Later, this 9.39 kilometer long project will have direct toll gate access from JIIPE. Not only road access and various infrastructure such as water, gas and electricity networks that have been and are being built at JIIPE. The government also provides various one-stop tax and licensing facilities through KEK administrators.\"\n\n(AKR Corporindo Tbk Annual Report 2022, 2023, akr.co.id/storage/reports ): \n\"In 2013, the Company and PELINDO established a joint venture for the JIIPE in East Java. JIIPE covers 3,000 ha with an Industrial Estate of 1,761 ha, Deep Sea Port of 406 ha, and residential area developed by affiliate of the company making it one of the largest Private Public Sector Partnerships in Indonesia. AKR through its subsidiary UEPN indirectly owns 60% of the Company shares, and Pelindo indirectly owns 40% through its subsidiary BJTI. On June 28, 2021, the Government issued Government Regulation (PP) No. 71 of 2021 that established JIIPE as a Technology & Manufacturing SEZ (Special Economic Zone) making it one of the most competitive Industrial Estates, in demand by industrial players in the Java and Eastern Indonesia regions. Gresik JIIPE SEZ is Special Economic Zone for Technology and Manufacturing also a National Strategic Project. JIIPE SEZ is home to the world’s largest Copper Smelter. The groundbreaking of this project was held in August 2021.\n...\nJIIPE has been designated as a Technology & Manufacturing Special Economic Zone and officially named JIIPE Gresik SEZ. This was stipulated in Government Regulation (PP) No. 71 of 2021 dated June 28, 2021 which was signed by the President of the Republic of Indonesia, Joko Widodo. On November 20, 2022, the Gresik Java Integrated Industrial and Port Estate Special Economic Zone (KEK JIIPE) officially received an operational certificate based on the National Council for Special Economic Zones (SEZ) Chairman’s Decree No. 1 of 2022 concerning Determination to Operate SEZ Gresik, and was ratified by the Coordinating Minister for the Economy Airlangga Hartarto as Chairman of the National Council. As an official Special Economic Zone, JIIPE is facilitated by the SEZ administration office that provides one-stop permit services, and other incentives and benefits including fiscal incentives such as lower income tax, customs tax and non-fiscal incentives such as easy passage of goods, and flexibility in employment, etc.\"\n\n(PT AKR Corporindo Tbk press release, 8/31/2023, marketscreener.com): Hebang Group to invest USD 800 Million in SEZ JIIPE Term Sheet signed for Joint Venture with AKR Corporindo for Petrochemical Manufacturing Plant August 31, 2023\n\"PT AKR Corporindo Tbk (IDX Stock Code: AKRA.IJ) today announced that Sichuan Hebang Biotechnology Co.

Until now, the progress has reached 60 percent with a quite large budget amounting to US$1.5 billion. If it is not finished, it will be such a waste,\" he said at the Presidential Palace Complex in Jakarta on Friday.\nCurrently, PT Freeport Indonesia is building a new copper smelter in Manyar, Special Economic Zone (KEK), Java Integrated Industrial and Port Estate (JIIPE), Gresik, East Java, which is targeted to become fully operational in 2024.\nThe Indonesian government has verified the construction progress of the Manyar smelter to be more than 50 percent complete, Tasrif informed.\nHowever, referring to Law Number 3 of 2020 concerning Mineral and Coal Mining (Minerba), three years after the regulation was issued on June 10, 2020, that is, from June 10, 2023, all raw minerals meant for export will need to go through a process of increasing added value in the country. Therefore, the government will also need to stop exports of raw minerals, including copper.\n\"We have decided to allow the export of copper concentrate. PT Freeport Indonesia must also finish the smelter and not later than the middle of next year,\" he said.\nApart from PT Freeport Indonesia, Tasrif said that PT Amman Mineral Nusa Tenggara (AMNT) has also been allowed to export copper concentrate.\nIt is known that PT Freeport Indonesia and AMNT are also building a new copper concentrate processing plant in Batu Hijau, West Sumbawa district, West Nusa Tenggara (NTT), at an estimated investment value of US$982 million, or equivalent to Rp14.7 trillion. However, the construction schedule has been delayed due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\"If the construction is hampered, it will affect thousands of workers there. We hope the company to have a commitment to finish the project. For now, we are aiming to achieve industrial downstreaming by taking advantage of natural resources as much as possible,\" Tasrif said.\nThe Manyar smelter project is projected to process 1.7 million tons of copper concentrate per year into around 600 thousand tons of cathode copper per year.\"\n\n(PT AKR Corporindo Tbk, 3/30/2023, akr.co.id): PT HAILIANG NOVA MATERIAL INDONESIA signs Binding Land Sale and Purchase Agreement for building Copper Foil Production Factory in JIIPE SEZ\n\"On 29th March 2023, a Binding Sale and Purchase Agreement was entered into between Hailiang and BKMS. Pursuant to the Agreement, BKMS has agreed to sell, and Hailiang has agreed to purchase a large lot of industrial land for the construction of Hailiang’s copper foil production plant in JIIPE Special Economic Zone (SEZ JIIPE).\nZheijang Hailiang Co., Ltd - Listed at Shenzhen Stock Exchange (stock code: 002203) in January 2008, Zhejiang Hailiang Co., Ltd. is devoted to the R&D, manufacture, sales and services of high-end copper products (copper pipes, rods, pipe connectors, new conductor materials and copper processing equipment, etc.).

The construction is halfway done, specifically 51.7 percent complete as of the end of December 2022. \n\"So the downstream and upstream sectors would become one. Refining copper domestically would boost the added values for the copper concentrate from the current 95 percent to 100 percent,” Freeport Indonesia president director Tony Wenas told BTV in a recent interview.\n“And also contribute to the EV ecosystem that is currently being built in Indonesia. Copper will play a pivotal role in the EV ecosystem,” Tony said.\nThe $3 billion Manyar Smelter is expected to process 1.7 million tons of copper concentrates a year. Freeport’s existing smelter PT Smelting has an annual capacity of a million tons of copper concentrates. Combined, Freeport Indonesia’s copper concentrate processing capacity can reach 3 million tons a year. Freeport Indonesia claimed the Manyar plant would become the world’s largest single-line smelter. \nThe Manyar Smelter is slated to begin commercial operations in end-2024, marking the end of copper concentrate ore exports from Freeport Indonesia.\" ",

Meanwhile, KITW has a special status because it holds the status of a National Strategic Project (PSN) in accordance with Presidential Regulation (Perpres) 58 of 2017, so that processing regional permits can be made easier.  Wilmar Project and Technical Director Erik Tjia said that investment growth had indeed slowed down due to the pandemic, but it was predicted that it would soon increase after the economy recovered. He is optimistic that the growing economy will have a positive impact on industrial area businesses.  \"We hope that the value of incoming investment will continue to increase,\" said Erik Tjia in a press conference at KITW, Serang, Banten, Friday (28/10/2022).  \nKITW Serang has made a positive contribution to the region through paying regional taxes, absorbing 70 percent-80 percent of the workforce from local communities, and other multiplier-effects . Erik explained that of the total land reserved for the development of KITW covering an area of ​​800 ha, 200 ha had been utilized for Wilmar's interests, in the form of building factories for cooking oil, rice, margarine, biodiesel, flour, jetties, packaging and employee housing. \nApart from Wilmar, several investors have entered the area, such as Perusahaan Gas Negara (PGN) and PT Baja Putra Deli.  Erik hopes that with KITW's status as a PSN, it will be easier to obtain permits and support from the central and regional governments to accelerate investment growth.  \"Investment is one of the pillars of economic growth,\" said Erik.  According to the Business Unit Head of PT Multimas Nabati Asahan Serang, Wilmar Tenang Sembiring group, as an industrial area, KITW is equipped with various facilities, such as asphalt roads that have access to toll roads, gas supplies of up to 20 million standard cubic feet per day (million standard cubic feet per day / MMSCFD), electricity supply up to 500 mega watts (MW), water, fiber optics, hydrant systems, waste processing ( incineration plant ), waste water treatment ( water treatment ), public facilities, and railways.  \"We plan to continue developing this area,\" he said Even though it has very adequate facilities, Wilmar still has difficulties regarding vehicle access, especially trucks, from the toll road to the KITW area because there is no direct access. Currently, transport trucks have to pass through small roads and even residential areas to reach KITW.  Tenang further said that another double effect was the absorption of workers, which currently at KITW has reached around 2,000 people, including construction workers.  Erik and Tenang hope that Wilmar's presence at KITW can supply food needs for Indonesia, especially Jabodetabek.\"",

Indo Surya Kencana, as one of the initiators of road repairs in the area, had the opportunity and was welcomed by the Management of the Pasar Kemis Industrial Area to work together in a spirit of mutual cooperation between the management and all companies in the area to repair several parts of the road that were damaged. quite serious.\nBagoes Sukmawan as HRD and GA Manager PT. Indo Surya Kencana said in front of the media crew that the company he manages has currently carried out improvements to the road infrastructure in the Pasar Kemis Industrial Area.\n\"Considering the importance of road infrastructure for many people, it was like a welcome response to the full support of the area management recently as a form of social responsibility towards the environment,\" said Bagoes in his office on Saturday (23/7/2022).\nBagoes explained that the important thing in supporting the company's business is road infrastructure. Unfortunately, several parts of the road in the area were damaged quite badly so that apart from being dangerous for road users, of course this also disrupted the continuity of the Company's operations in general.\n\"Given the importance of road infrastructure for many communities, PT. \"Indo Surya Kencana, as one of the initiators in road repairs in the area, has the full support of the management to improve the area's road infrastructure,\" said Bagoes.\nBagoes continued that the backfill project which started in April 2022 has started to show results and will continue until completion as a form of commitment from the Area Management and all companies located around the location.\n\"We have high hopes as the management of PT Indo Surya Kencana that this road can be useful for the surrounding community and all employees around the location in carrying out their daily driving activities. \"Apart from being beneficial for local residents, it is of course also beneficial for employees and the company,\" he said.\nBagoes said that apart from smoothing traffic flow, management believes that the repair of the smiling road will also improve the health level of local residents where previously there were puddles of water, and since the part of the road that has been repaired, the puddles are no longer visible.\n\"The real benefit that can be truly felt by employees and the company is the increased productivity of employees and the company itself because travel times are shorter,\" he said.\nAccording to Bagoes, hopefully this can trigger and ignite a sense of concern for all owners or leaders of nearby companies, to be able to contribute to improving road access in the Pasar Kemis Industrial Area.\n\"So that the better condition of the area will bring in investment and absorb more human resources in the environment around the location,\" said Bagoes.\nBagoes continued that Banten is the youngest province on the island of Java, where in one of its cities there is an area which has the nickname \"City of a Thousand Factories\", Tangerang Regency.\n\"Here there are various companies from various types of industries, both in the form of PMA and PMDN,\" explained Bagoes.\nSeparately, Siti is a production employee at PT. Indo Surya said in front of the media crew that since the area's roads were repaired, the distance traveled has become faster.\n\"Since the construction of this regional road, I now don't need to rush for time. \"It's different before this road was built, I was always pressed for time,\" he said.\"\n\n(Tangerang News, 12/8/2020, tangerangnews.com): 3 Years The Road in the Pasar Kemis Industrial Area Was Left Severely Damaged\nThe main road in the Pasar Kemis Industrial Area, Tangerang Regency suffered serious damage. This condition has been going on for three years.\n\"I've been working in this area for about 3 years. The road has always been like this,\" said Ira, one of the factory workers in the Pasar Kemis Industrial Area, Tuesday (8/12/2020).\nThis road is often used as access for workers and heavy factory vehicles in the area. If it rains, the road conditions are flooded and slippery.\nEven though it is not suitable, the road is still used because it is the only access.\n\"No one of my fellow workers complained, they're already used to it. When we pass, we take the road that goes this way (in the opposite direction), where the damage isn't too bad,\" added Ira.\nRoad users, who are factory workers, pass this road when they want to get to or from work. Not a few people also pass through that road.\n\"It is hoped that related parties can overcome the problem of damaged roads in this area,\" said Ira.\"",

February 2023 article states that the KEK has developed electricity capacity much greater than tenants' electricity demand, resulting in state losses.\n\n(Tribun Medan, 2/14/2023, medan.tribunnews.com): The Sei Mangkei SEZ Development Failed, Now It's Losing Due to Electricity Overstock\n\"Since it was first built, the Sei Mangkei Special Economic Zone (KEK) was designated by the Government as an economic area consisting of an Industrial Zone, Logistics Zone and Tourism Zone based on Government Regulation Number 29 of 2012.\nHowever, instead of making a profit from the Sei Mangkei SEZ, a number of problems actually occurred at the national project location.\nThe Indonesian BPK found that there was a mismatch between the availability of electricity and the needs of companies there, which resulted in state losses.\nBPK RI Inspection Result Report (LHP) Number.34/AUDITAMA VII/PDTT/04/2022, published on April 20 2022, stated that the power supply was in accordance with the Sei Mangkei SEZ development roadmap , namely 400.5 (MW). \nHowever, electricity demand is lower than availability, where there are only six customers who have the potential to use electrical power in the Sei Mangke SEZ, namely the Sei Mangke Kernel Factory, PTPN III PLTBS, PT Kinra, Sei Mangkei Infrastructure Development.\nThen there is PT Unilever Oleochemical Indonesia , PT Industri Nabati Lestari. \nThe total power used by the six companies is only 13.8 MW.\nThis means that there is a difference in power between the Power Provider's plan and the Realization of -386.7 MW. \nPublic Policy Observer Pratama Saragih assesses that the attractiveness of the Sei Mangkei SEZ has failed in the eyes of potential investors.\nThe Sei Mangkei SEZ is not being looked at for companies to stay and produce benefits for the country.\nApart from that, on a small scale, there is an element of deliberateness in determining the planning for the construction of the Main Substation (GI) in question due to inconsistency in the realization of use and planning.\n\"It would be very ironic if the realization of phase I power usage (MW) from 2010 to 2013 was zero. \"This is a disgraceful act, it has been accommodated and it turns out there is no result,\" said Pratama.\nThe owner of the Role Of The Ombudsman In Access To Justice certificate, said that the construction of a 150 kV Main Substation (GI) in Dagang, Simalungun Regency is not in accordance with the feasibility study because a project is declared feasible if the Net Benefit (net profit) is positive.\n\"Meanwhile, BPK RI's findings regarding the project are negative. This requires a strong warning from the Minister of BUMN and the Simalungun Regency Government, because there are state losses that are not recorded by BPK-RI where there is a difference in Megawatt (MW) supply and demand for electricity that can be converted into rupiah which has the potential to be forfeited. \"This will be detrimental to the country,\" he concluded.\"",

This is in line with its commitment in the coordination meeting to resolve underground water use held by the Corruption Eradication Commission (KPK) together with the Ministry of Industry, North Sumatra Provincial Government (North Sumatra), Deli Serdang Regency Government, Medan City Government, and the KIM Company Association on March 17 2022 and November 23 2022. PT KIM President Director Daly Mulyana explained the progress of clean water infrastructure development and explained each progress, namely the first was the construction of the Water Treatment Plant (WTP) phase 2.\nOn October 19 2022, Daly said that KIM began construction of WTP phase 2 as a continuation of WTP phase 1 with a total available clean water capacity of 500,000 to 600,000 m3/month. \n\"On May 3 2023, a Commissioning Test was carried out to test the operational readiness of WTP Phase 2 and is targeted to be fully operational in June 2023. As part of the Build, Operate & Transfer cooperation package, WTP Phase 2 was built by PT Dain Celicani Cemerlang, as a partner PT KIM clean water cooperation, through PT KIM supervision,\" he said in a statement quoted on Thursday (8/6/2023). Then the second is the development and utilization of underground water. In line with the Corruption Eradication Commission's direction at the coordination meeting on November 23 2022 in efforts to stop the use of groundwater in the Medan Industrial Area as well as extraordinary steps by PT KIM to meet water needs, construction and utilization of groundwater was carried out by PT KIM. \nThis is in accordance with the letter from the Ministry of Industry Number B1284/KPAII.3/PWI/IV/2022 dated 14 April 2022 based on the Minister of Industry Regulation Number 40 of 2016 concerning Technical Guidelines for Industrial Area Development.  In its implementation, KIM is now synergizing with Danareksa Holding members, namely PT Jasa Tirta Luhur in building wells which will be utilized at 300,000 m3/month and distributed to tenants in the Medan Industrial Area.  \"The project began work on January 27 2023 with a contract value of IDR 22 billion and is targeted to operate in June 2023,\" he continued. The third is the collaboration between Perumda Tirtanadi. Daly explained that KIM synergized with Perumda Tirtanadi, which is the Regional Owned Enterprise (BUMD) of North Sumatra Province which serves industrial and household water needs in North Sumatra. \nHe also explained that Perumda Tirtanadi is committed to serving the needs of KIM Block 1 tenants amounting to 200,000 m3/month in June 2023. Lastly, construction of reservoirs and clean water distribution networks. Daly explained that KIM invested in the construction of a reservoir (storage tank) and clean water distribution pipe network in synergy with Danareksa Holding members.  \"As a state-owned company with experience in planning, PT KIM appointed PT Indra Karya to carry out the study and PT Nindya Karya as the contractor for the construction of reservoirs and clean water distribution networks with a volume of 300,000 m3/month with a pipe length of 5 km,\" continued Daly. Through this reservoir, he said again, clean water will be stored and distributed through a network of distribution pipes to all tenants according to their needs. With an investment of around IDR 65 billion, this project is targeted for completion in June 2023. As a subsidiary of BUMN and a member of Danareksa Holding, PT KIM invests in clean water infrastructure as a form of meeting the water needs of tenants in the area. \nIn line with the increase in water absorption by tenants, it is hoped that no tenants will use groundwater as is prohibited in Government Regulation Number 142 of 2015 concerning Industrial Areas.  In every investment budget preparation until its implementation, PT KIM applies the principles of prudence and Good Corporate Governance, namely referring to the regulations that apply within the BUMN environment and at Danareksa Holding as well as PT KIM's internal regulations.\"\n\n(Danareksa, 2023, danareksa.co.id): \"PT. Medan Industrial Estate is a State-Owned Enterprise (BUMN) with an industrial estate management service business sector established on October 7, 1988 with a share composition consisting of 1 share Seri A (Dwiwarna) owned the Government of the Republic of Indonesia,  PT Danareksa (Persero) 59,99%, the Provincial Government of North Sumatra 30%, and the Medan City Government 10%.\nAlong with the establishment of this area, the higher the interest of investors to invest in North Sumatra.

In March 2020, a Chinese employee at the park became sick with COVID.\n\n(Ketapang Holding Group, 2018, GlobalWood.org): \"Established in 2016, Jiangsu Ketapang agricultural and forestry ecological industrial construction and development Co. LTD engages in agricultural and forestry industrial park infrastructure investment, construction, management. In the same year, the company invested to set up \"Indonesian Ketapang agricultural and forestry ecological industrial park co., LTD...\nLocated in lumber-and-land resource rich virgin forest, the program is positioned as based on planting, while making the most of its natural advantages to provide quality raw materials for wood and cassava products manufacturers.The project starts from the manufacturing industry (wood industry) ,expanding to the agricultural and forestry animal husbandry (quick growth forest, cassava, palm trees, fruit trees and other planting, agricultural and forestry product processing. Poultry farming, agricultural and forestry products research and development), and related manufacturing industries (paper making, palm oil, monosodium glutamate, feed, juice, freezing, etc.) logistics transportation industry, education, culture, tourism, etc.\nThe park has a planned area of five square kilometers and a total investment of about $800 million,which is divided into three phases of development and construction. The planned area of the first phase is 1 square kilometer from 2016 to 2019, the second phase 2 square kilometers from 2019 to 2022 while the third phase is 2 square kilometers from 2022 to 2025.\nThe first phase of the industrial park, with a total investment of $130 million dollars and a construction area of 1 square kilometer, is divided into two parts: infrastructure construction and housing construction with infrastructure construction mainly includes excavation of 12.5 km river channels, 13.8 km main road , 22.6km of open channel ditch,1 km embankment pier,10 bridges, 32808 square meters of square/stadium,8 power distribution rooms,1056 square meters of tap water/sewage treatment/waste treatment plants,20000 square meters of thermal power plant, 93581 square meters of wood, cassava yard as well as 300,000 square meters of greening.\nThe total 271760 square meters construction area is mainly used for 4346 square meters of commercial housing, 5033 square meters of hotel, 9821 square meters of staff dormitory, 6386 square meters of maintenance workshop, 5640 square meters of production auxiliary room,3545 square meters of office building and 236990 square meters of production premises.\nAt present, the construction of infrastructure and housing of the industrial park have been basically completed . About 70,000 square meters of factory buildings, 5,000 square meters of hotels and 30MW coal-fired power plants started construction in August ,2018 with the construction of the factory and hotel will be done in October 2019, and the power plant scheduled to start operation in February 2020 .\nBy August 2018, the first phase of the industrial park has been completed, and the factory and facilities have been put into use.\nThe industrial park began construction in 2016 and more than 20 enterprises will move in by 2019, covering varies fields including culture, education, scientific research, energy, auxiliary materials packaging, logistics and transportation,agricultural and forestry planting, breeding, cultivating, forest products processing, agricultural products and livestock products processing. By August 2018, there were already 14 enterprises setting up business in the park with an investment of about $200 million. In the future, 8 to 10 enterprises will start operating in the park, investing about $400 million dollars.\nThe core enterprise, BSM, undertook the installation and debugging of production equipment in 2017, and started trial operation in 2018, now having reached its production capacity. BSM expands its production line to pellet production,which is exported to Japan and South Korea, thus achieving 100% utilization of wood. Currently, the factory has 500 local employees and 30 Chinese technicians with plans to add 20 more Chinese managerial personnel and 1,000 more Indonesian employees.\nBased on the 196,000 hectares of virgin forest and planting woodland owned by the enterprises in the park and the 700,000 hectares of land resources jointly developed with the local government,the cluster area of the industrial park will extend to both ends of the wood products and cassava industry chain, ultimately encompassing trees/cassava breeding and planting, logs/cassava processing,wood products/starch products production, export sales,ancillary facility agricultural and forestry technology learning, energy power generation, bio-fuel, sewage waste treatment, logistics transportation, mechanical processing, auxiliary material production and other industries, and offering one-stop service including customs, commodity inspection, bank and commercial service, hotel, living facilities, personnel and finance.\nThrough integration of upstream and downstream industrial chain of agricultural and forestry products, the enterprises within the park aims for gradual expansion of improved seed cultivation, supply and large-scale planting, which will not only solve the problem of raw material supply, but also help to form a whole circular industrial chain of agricultural and forestry product research and development, seedling cultivation, agricultural and forestry planting, product production and export, thus ultimately improving the ability of overseas assets to resist risks. As a result of resource and labor cost advantages, when products are shipped back to China for sale, it reduces production cost for enterprises on the one hand and increases tax revenue for the country on the other hand.\nPhase two, phase three of the project will copy the first phase of the project model, at the same time continuing to expand the planting and manufacturing scale,introducing breeding enterprises, fertilizer factories, alcohol plants, sugar refineries, seedling breeding firms, agricultural machinery repair companies, agricultural technology training centers, etc. By 2025, when the five-square-kilometer industrial park is completed construction and fully put into operation, it is expected to generate $12 billion in sales and $1.5 billion in tax revenue for the Chinese government every year. In addition, the development of agroforestry eco-tourism will also be carried out to make Ketapang a featured demonstration city integrating agroforestry planting, ecological cultivation, agroforestry processing and ecological tourism.Based on the principle of protective use of natural resources, prioritizing environmental protection and rational utilization of ecological resources, facilitating trade, we strive to build a modern agricultural, forestry,ecological tourism industry clusters harmonizing agricultural, forestry and animal husbandry cultivation with agricultural, forestry and animal husbandry production base, seasonal scientific planting, agricultural and forest product processing and ecological tourism, making Ketapang industrial park a model project of \"One Belt And One Road\" agricultural and forestry cooperation between China and Indonesia.\"\n\n(Antara News, 10/11/2017, kalbar.antaranews.com): Ketapang Regent Invites People to Plant Sweet Potatoes\n\"Ketapang Regent Martin Rantan invited the community to promote cassava planting as a step to improve the economy in the area.\n\"Land that is not yet productive can be used to plant cassava.

The presence of the company investing in Ketapang is expected to develop Ketapang.\n\"In investing we will focus on planting and processing,\" he said.\nIn looking for investment locations, his party has been in Indonesia since 2000. However, from the various regions explored, Ketapang Regency was considered to provide good service and received support from regional heads in exploring the community's economic potential.\n\"Moreover, the land here is suitable for planting jabon, albizia, cassava, rice and corn. However, here we see seeds that are not good so we will invite professors and experts to do research,\" he said.\nTo overcome the seed problem, a 30 hectare nursery area will also be built at the company location with an investment of around IDR 30 billion.\n\"Again, we will invite experts, both from Indonesia and China, to improve the quality of cassava plantations,\" he said.\"\n\n(Ketapang News, 7/15/2017, ketapangnews.com): Chinese Investors Open Industrial Zones\n\"Ketapang Ecology and Agriculture Foresty Industrial Park plans to open the largest industrial area in Ketapang Regency, the Chinese company plans to invest IDR 4.5 trillion in the fields of PLTU, drinking water processing and other industries such as glue, Plywood, tapioca flour, bricks, manufacturing machines and special ports.\nThe land information exposure that was opened directly by Regent Martin Rantan, SH accompanied by the Main Director of PT Ketapang Ecology Yu Yiping, Head of Public Works Department PR Donatus Gaza, as well as related SKPD, Muara Pawan community leaders took place in the Hall of the Regent of Ketapang Friday (14/7).\nRegent Martin Rantan SH in his direction said that investment in Ketapang Regency was a central program during the time when President SBY collaborated with the President of China after which President Jokowi followed up.\n\"This meeting is very important and strategic because we support the President's program from SBY to Jokowi,\" said the Regent.\nThe Regent conveyed that although PT Ketapang Ecology and Agriculture Foresty Industrial Park has obtained permission from BKPM RI, some of the land is affected by swamp irrigation drainage, which is the authority and asset of the West Kalimantan Provincial Government.\n\"Therefore, we ask for an explanation from them after completing their responsibilities to the Central Government and Provincial Government,\" said the Regent.\nAfter the land information disclosure is complete, the Regent will issue a location permit, but the Regent emphasized that if after this exposure there is no further permit processing and no development activity, then it will no longer be valid.\nIn the pre-survey report, it is stated that the location of the planned activities is in Nipah Malang hamlet, Sei Awan Kanan Village, Muara Pawan District, while the industrial area uses an area of ​​90.78 ha, with the main director being Yu Tiping.\nPT Ketapang Ecology and Agriculture Foresty Industrial Park was established in Indonesia in accordance with applicable law, on June 10 2016 with PMA status with issued capital of USD.7,500,000 (seven million five hundred thousand US dollars) or around Rp. 1.2 billion rupiah.\nThe first stage investment value is IDR, USD 50 thousand or IDR, 675 billion rupiah.

This refinery extension is located in the Surya Borneo Industrial Area and is planned to be built in the first quarter of 2023 and will only be completed in the first quarter of 2025.\nWith this refinery extension, crude palm kernel oil or Crude Palm Kernel Oil (CPKO) will be processed into RBDPKO (Refined Bleached Deodorized Palm Kernel Oil) into raw materials for cocoal butter and PKFAD (Palm Kernel Palm Fatty Acid Distillate) which has business prospects which is more promising.\nPT Citra Borneo Utama Tbk Corporate Secretary Deni Agustinus said that in 2023 Citra Borneo's business prospects will remain good. This is because local and export demand for olein is still high.\n\"Meanwhile, the supply of raw materials, CPO, is limited due to the B35 provisions,\" he explained some time ago.\nDeni explained that these supply and demand conditions have caused prices to stabilize and there is a possibility of rising again if demand from export destination countries such as China and India increases ahead of celebrations in the near future.\nApart from relying on CPO derivative products such as olein, Citra Borneo Utama will also encourage sales of cooking oil.

Future plans for PT SBI will build a container depot, logistics center, and  will carry out a consortium with Pelindo, PT Wilmar, Jass Marine .\nCentral Kalimantan Bappedalitbang Kaspinor explained, since five years ago assistance from Central Kalimantan Provincial Public Works has entered Kobar Regency to support this KISB, namely the construction of a road from the Pangkalan Lima roundabout to KISB (Regency road assisted by the Province). Around IDR 20 billion is still needed to build roads that are still damaged for approximately 1.3 km.\n\"These coordination meetings and field visits were held in order to speed up the coordination process. Collaboration is easy to say but not easy to implement,\" said Kaspinor.\n\"I have been appointed as Head of the Water Resources Management Coordination Team, Irrigation Team and others from the Center as a result of the area being designated as a development priority by the Center,\" he added.\nTherefore, Kaspinor continued, in order to find out in more detail the conditions and situation in the field, coordination meetings and visits to the regions were also needed in order to synergize the vision of the government, private sector and BUMN, including cooperatives. Pancasila as an ideology is not only memorized, but also must be applied in the life of the nation and state to realize the Pancasila economy.\nKaspinor also said that PT SBI has become one of the leading companies in Central Kalimantan Province. For this reason, the provincial government is very supportive of industrial development. It is hoped that this industry will have an environmental perspective and local wisdom, taking into account water resources and air pollution in anticipation of the impacts that could arise later.\n\"It is hoped that this industry will have a big impact on the people of Central Kalimantan,\" he stated.

This step is because the company is considered no longer efficient to continue.\nThe dissolution of one of the listed subsidiaries with the stock code KRAS has received the blessing of the Minister of State-Owned Enterprises (BUMN) Erick Thohir.\nSilmy explained that before the liquidation was carried out, his party first looked for partners or business partners. Unfortunately, he did not explain further the link between the liquidation of MJIS and the management's efforts to find new business partners.\n\"Currently MJIS has received approval to be liquidated, but before this liquidation is executed, we are looking for partners,\" said Silmy in a Hearing Meeting (RDP) with Commission VI DPR RI, Monday, April 11.\nFor your information, MJIS is a joint venture between Krakatau Steel and PT Aneka Tambang Tbk (ANTM), Meratus Jaya Iron &. This company was founded on June 9, 2008. The company is engaged in the industry and steel products, trade and services related to steel.\nMJIS is located in South Kalimantan by utilizing local iron ore reserves. In 2012, the company operated one unit of an iron factory (rotary kiln) from the planned two units, with a total capacity of 315,000 tons of direct reduced iron (DRI) per year.\nThe rotary kiln unit produces sponge iron which is processed from local iron ore. Meanwhile, the power plant has produced electricity using gas fuel from the rotary kiln factory unit. When it reaches full capacity, the electricity produced is 18 MW. In collaboration with PLN, this excess electricity will be distributed to the surrounding communities and small industries.\nHowever, MJIS experienced problems in its operation, in the form of limited infrastructure and delays in delivery of goods, installation and assembling of equipment. Because there was a commitment from the contractor PT Krakatau Engineering and shareholders, ANTM and KRAS were finally able to overcome these obstacles.\n\"But this can't be used because it's already inefficient and the location is far from further production,\" he said.\nQuoted from the Meratus Jaya website, this company has been operating since 2008 and has stopped operating due to falling iron ore prices on the world market. Thus, the selling price is not competitive.\nThis company has also been in production for approximately 3 years and has made the first shipment of sponge iron products of 5,000 metric tons to Krakatau Steel.\n\"Krakatau Steel itself, we no longer use sponge iron,\" he said.\"\n\n(Mariono, 9/6/2022, kalsel.antaranews.com): \"'Regarding KI Batulicin, it consists of block one and block two. Development progress is in block two, including a biodiesel factory and currently in the process of building a nickel smelter which absorbs 1,200 workers.\n'KI Batulicin block one has an area of ​​around 950 hectares and block two has an area of ​​1,700 hectares,' he said.\nThe locations of block one and block two are very close together so that the interest of business actors to invest in KI Batulicin is very high.\nCoupled with the existence of airports, industrial areas, and ports which are very close, as well as electricity and water facilities to support these industrial areas.\"\n\n(SMM, 12/22/2021, news.metal.com) Construction of the South Kalimantan Nickel smelter will begin in April 2022\n\"Jhonlin Group plans to build a nickel smelter in Tanah Bumbu, South Kalimantan, a development goal that will be achieved in 2022.\nPT Jhonlin Agro Raya (JAR) owns a piece of land of 2000 hectares in the Simpang Empat district of Tanah Bumbu, where its biodiesel plant is currently built, which was recently built by Indonesian President H Joko Widodo Ir H.. With the unveiling, other types of factories will follow.\nH Andi Syamsudin Arsyad, owner of, PT Jhonlin Group on December 17, 2021, said: \"in the future, we will build smelters or nickel smelters.\"\nEntrepreneur H Isam explained that the presence of SEZs in Tanah Bumbu is expected to absorb more than 10, 000 local workers and promote economic development in Tanah Bumbu and South Kalimantan. If nothing happens, the nickel smelter is scheduled to start research and construction in April 2022, with four production lines expected. Jhonlin Group will invest at least about $440 million. The nickel smelter will be the first and only Tanah Bumbu Regency in South Kalimantan.\nThe processing results of the Batulicin smelter will be shipped abroad in the form of semi-finished products and become finished products in the form of battery materials. The products of the smelter are then satisfied with domestic demand, as well as countries with other potential markets in the world. In response to the plan to build a smelter, Zairullah Azhar HM, Regent of Tanbu, continues to provide support.\"\n\n(Trihusodo, 11/1/2021, Indonesia.go.id): Bright Industrial Prospects in Batulicin\n\"A biodiesel plant operates in the Batulicin Industrial area. In the same place, the iron ore smelter is being revitalized. \"The government continues to push for an increase in biodiesel.\nIn the third week of August 2021, President Jokowi inaugurated a biodiesel factory in the Batulicin City industrial area, Tanah Bumbu Regency, South Kalimantan Province. The factory, which stands on an industrial area of ​​2,000 ha, is directly connected to the beach. The factory processes crude palm oil (CPO) into 1,500 tons of biodiesel per day, and was built with an investment of IDR 2 trillion.\nThe Batulicin biofuel industry is owned by Haji Isam, the popular name of businessman Syamsudin Andi Arsyad, who is known as the richest man and concurrently the coal king of South Kalimantan. ''I am willing to come here because this industry can open up great job opportunities,'' President Jokowi said in his remarks.\nSecond, he continued, the downstream industry can maintain the stability of palm oil prices, both in the domestic and international markets. Palm oil has a wider market. ''That way, the price can be more stable. Don't let our goods be owned, but the market will determine the price,'' said President Jokowi.\nPresident Jokowi also said that the Jhonlin Group's initiative to build a biodiesel factory was a downstream step for raw commodities that had to be encouraged. The head of state also hopes that PT Jhonlin and other business groups can conduct downstream activities more broadly. ''Either used as cooking oil, cosmetics, or other finished goods. I appreciate what PT Jhonlin Group has done, which certainly provides great added value,' said Jokowi...\nIndustrial area\nIn his report to President Jokowi, Commissioner of PT Jhonlin Agro Raya Andi Amran Sulaiman, (former Indonesian Minister of Agriculture 2014-2019), said that the biodiesel industry in Batulicin, with all its supporting industries upstream, can absorb up to 20,000 workers. There are thousands of others who are indirectly related to the industrial business.\nIt is also believed that the biodiesel industry will revive the prestige of the dim Batulicin Industrial Area. The industrial area itself is part of the PT Jhonlin Group business. According to Amran, the smelter will operate again in the area which will process iron sand (iron rock) into iron billets for the steel industry. The raw material for iron sand and iron stone itself is quite a lot in South Kalimantan, especially on Derawan Island, Sebuku Island, besides there are many others available in Central Sulawesi.\nThe smelter industry Amran Sulaiman refers to belongs to PT Meratus Jaya Iron and Steel (MJIS), a joint venture between two BUMNs, namely PT Krakatau Steel (Persero) Tbk and PT Aneka Tambang Tbk . The smelter operated for several years before closing in 2015 due to falling steel prices on the market. Occupying an area of ​​120 ha in Batulicin, the smelter owned by PT Meratus Jaya is currently being revitalized and is expected to return to production in 2023.\nThe Batulicin Industrial Area is one of 120 industrial areas in Indonesia, and the only one in South Kalimantan. It is not surprising that the South Kalimantan Provincial Government and Tanah Bumbu Regency Government have encouraged the industrial area to continue to develop.\nCurrently, Kotabaru Port in Batulicin has entered the sea highway network, and is one of 33 ports in the sea highway network equipped with Inaportnet 4.0 infrastructure. Kotabaru Port has also been equipped with warehouses, passenger terminals, container terminals, and can serve ships with large tonnages. Bersujud Airport in Batulicin City also has a runway that is 1,850 meters long, only an additional 100-200 meters is needed for Boeing 737s to land on it.\nHowever, compared to those standing in East Kalimantan, the Batulicin Industrial Area is still quiet. Apart from the biodiesel factory, cooking oil factory and iron ore smelter which are currently being restored using the latest technology, the Batulicin Industrial Area is only inhabited by a handful of medium-scale factories. PT Jhonlin Group, for example, also operates a rubber and wood pellet processing industry, from wood industry waste, which is used as fuel for heating stoves in four-season homes. The wood pellets are exported to Europe.\nThere are still many industries that can be accommodated. The need for clean water for industry is easy to obtain. Electricity supply is also available in sufficient quantities, available from the Barito power grid, with the back pole of the Bengkanai PLTG in Central Kalimantan.\nPresident Jokowi also reminded the importance of upholding the commitment to abandon fossil energy and switch to new, renewable energy. Therefore, the President encouraged biodiesel production to continue to be increased. Andi Amran Sulaiman, as the Main Commissioner of PT Jhonlin Agro Raya, has invited industry players to enter Batulicin.\nThe biodiesel industry itself will continue to develop in the country.

It is unclear if there are any tenants already operating at BCIP; there is potentially an ammonium nitrate manufacturer (Batuta Kimia Perdana) operating onsite.\n\n(Reyes, 4/28/2022, argusmedia.com): Indonesia to build second coal gasificiation plant\n\"Indonesia's largest coal producer Bumi Resources and US chemical company Air Products and Chemicals will start developing a new Indonesian coal gasification facility by May.\nThis will be the second coal gasification facility being developed in Indonesia, the first being a joint venture project between Air Products, state-owned coal producer Bukit Asam and oil firm Pertamina. The $2bn project is expected to consume at least 6mn t/yr of coal to produce 1.8mn t/yr of methanol once operational, Bumi said.\nThe new gasification facility will be built at the Batuta Chemical Industrial Park (BCIP) located in Bengalon, east Kalimantan, Bumi added. The area is currently undergoing the second stage of land clearing in preparation for actual construction of the plant to begin. The facility is targeted for completion by late 2025 or early 2026.\nUnder an initial agreement by both companies, Bumi will supply coal for the facility through its Kaltim Prima Coal (KPC) mining subsidiary and its Ithaca Resources' Kaltim Nusantara Coal subsidiary. Both companies will be responsible for the offtake of the methanol produced, while Air Products will be the builder, owner, and operator of the facility.\nIndonesia's energy ministry (ESDM) welcomed the development of the new gasification facility, saying that these types of projects will help accelerate investments in the growing downstream coal sector.\nInvestments remain low because of the significant financial undertaking needed, as well as the lack of an existing market for coal derivative products, the ESDM said. The ESDM is hoping that the commercial operations of two large-scale coal gasification plants will demonstrate the economic feasibility of the downstream coal sector to industry players.\nThe methanol produced by the plant is expected to help reduce imports, and increase the value of lower-quality coal produced in Indonesia.\"\n\n(Media Kaltim, 4/26/2022, mediakaltim.com): A coal-to-methanol processing plant will soon be built in Kutim\n\"The government has started the construction of a coal gasification industry into dimethyl ether (DME) in East Kutai. The downstream industry for processing black gold into methanol is targeted to be completed in 2024. Academics have requested that policy makers prioritize local workers in this project.\nTo kaltimkece.id mediakaltim.com network, Tuesday, April 19 2022, the Head of the One-Stop Investment and Integrated Services Service (DPMPTSP), Puguh Harjanto, reported the progress of the construction of the coal gasification industry. Currently, the work is entering the land clearing stage at the Batuta Chemical Industrial Park (BCIP), Bengalon, East Kutai.\n\"We are currently in the second phase of the land clearing process. The construction has already been prepared,\" said Puguh when met at the Odah Etam Hall, Samarinda.\nFor information, the gasification project is being undertaken by PT Bakrie Capital Indonesia (BCI) and PT Ithaca Resources and Air Products from the United States. The project value is around USD 2 billion or IDR 30 trillion (exchange rate IDR 14,900/USD). If this project is completed, PT Bumi Resources TBK (BUMI) through its subsidiary, PT Kaltim Prima Coal, will become the supplier of the coal needs. The projected amount of coal is 6 million tons per year.\n\"This is included in the downstream strategy and increasing added value. God willing, we will control it,\" Puguh added.\nStill at the Odah Etam Hall, the East Kutai Regent, Ardiansyah, confirmed that the construction of a methanol processing plant is underway in his area. The project belongs to BCIP. Based on information received by Ardiansyah, the construction is targeted to be completed in 2024. Ardiansyah ensures that the project's development documents, such as an environmental impact analysis (Amdal), are complete and meet standards.\n\"It is impossible for land clearing to start without an EIA, how dare they,\" said the Regent.\"\n\n(Sya'rawie, 9/15/2021, kalimantan.bisnis.com: \"The East Kutai Regency (Kutim) government is conducting an evaluation regarding the development of institutional management of the Maloy Batuta Trans Kalimantan Special Economic Zone (KEK).

Batuta Chemical Industrial Park. The development is situated on the coastline of Makassar Strait and is planned to establish an integrated industrial development, which stimulates profitable business, especially for the coal industry. As a new profitable industrial park development, this project has three main success factors for the development strategy to establish a comprehensive industrial park. \nFirst, the development shall provide an integrated infrastructure network. Second, the development shall accommodate a self-sustained industrial estate development, and third, the development shall be planned to be the center of excellence in new coal processing.\nThe realization of these success factors requires the implementation of design principles that create a clear and functional development structure, flexible land parcels, green and blue infrastructure, and efficient phasing on the clustering.\nHalf of the approximately 943,8 hectares land area is designed to serve industrial programs. These programs are clustered based on coal processing and are part of Industrial Land, which will be sold out to investors. On the other hand, the Small Medium Enterprise (SME) area, which is part of the Industrial Building, will be rented out.\nTo enhance the feature as an integrated industrial park development, parts of the land area are also planned to support the industrial programs, such as commercial and public facilities, public amenities, potential transportation facilities (port), and a government office. More than 10% of the land area is covered by green area. The area is projected not only for open space but also preserved as an area for goods and services circulation.\"",

Other companies (not nickel-based) appear to be currently operational.\n\n(East Kalimantan Provinvial Government, 9/12/2023, kaltimprov.go.id): SMELTER INDUSTRY BUILT IN KARIANGAU, STARTING PRODUCTION IN 2025, DEPUTY GOVERNOR: PRIORITIZE LOCAL RESIDENTS\n\"BALIKPAPAN – The potential for developing the nickel industry is increasingly enthusiastic in East Kalimantan. PT Mitra Murni Perkasa (MMP), which is part of the MMS Group Indonesia (MMSGI), started construction of a matte nickel smelter at the Kariangau Site, West Balikpapan, Monday (11/9/2023). The inauguration was carried out by the Minister of Industry Agus Gumiwang Kartasasmita accompanied by the Deputy Governor of East Kalimantan H Hadi Mulyadi and the Mayor of Balikpapan Rahmad Mas'ud. \nDeputy Governor of East Kalimantan H Hadi Mulyadi appreciated the construction of this smelter. Especially because Balikpapan, especially in the Kariangau industrial area, was chosen as the location for the construction of a matte nickel smelter by PT MMP. \n\"This is an honor for East Kalimantan. Hopefully it will provide benefits to the people of East Kalimantan and the Indonesian nation,\" said Deputy Governor Hadi Mulyadi. \nThe Deputy Governor added that this industry could provide great benefits for the people of East Kalimantan. Moreover, this matte nickel smelter is the first to be built in East Kalimantan. In the near future, a second nickel smelter will also be built in the Penkerja area, Sanga Sanga District, Kutai Kartanegara. \n\"We hope that PT MMP will be able to increase the economic growth of the people of East Kalimantan. Then, most importantly, its CSR can be beneficial for the community and provide employment for many local residents in East Kalimantan,\" said Deputy Governor Hadi. \nFor Hadi, this development is not only beneficial for the community. However, it is also able to keep the environment well maintained. In fact, with this development, there will certainly be synergy in developing the development needs for the National Capital of the Archipelago (IKN) which have been determined by President Joko Widodo on the Etam Continent. \n\"We hope that labor absorption will really be maximum, especially for local workers. Because the construction of this smelter will be connected to the development of IKN,\" he explained.\nDuring the inauguration, the Minister of Industry, Agus Gumiwang Kartasasmita, also appreciated PT MMP's initiative to build this future industry. \n\"Thank God, I appreciate that PT MMP has invested in the downstream nickel matte smelter in Kariangau Balikpapan,\" said Minister Agus Gumiwang. \nHe said that the development of this industry also supports the domestic goods production program or Increased Use of Domestic Products (P3DN) and Domestic Component Level (TKDN). \nThis product downstream leads to batteries. This production will be correlated with IKN's electricity needs and the high use of electric vehicles. \n\"Of course, if all this can go well. Of course, it will provide benefits for producers. Starting from the mining, smelters and battery production companies,\" he said. \n\"What is clear is that if the product is a battery, the target is the automotive sector. Therefore, currently preparations are being made to develop the raw materials to become batteries. So, the government believes that the growth value of P3DN will increase,\" he explained.  \n\"Congratulations and success, I am sure this development will benefit the community, according to President Joko Widodo's hopes,\" he said.   \nMeanwhile, the President Director of PT MMP, Adhi Mustopo, said that the matte nickel target is to reach 27,000 metric tons with a nickel content of 78 percent. \n\"In 2025, we will be able to produce batteries. We hope to be able to build green energy and green batteries too,\" he explained.\nThe event was attended by Military Commander VI Mulawarman Major General TNI Tri Budi Utomo, East Kalimantan Regional Police Chief Inspector General Imam Sugianto, East Kalimantan Kajati Hari Setiyono, Head of the East Kalimantan High Court Nyoman Gede Wirya, East Kalimantan and Balikpapan Forkopimda, Director General of Information and Technology of the Indonesian Minister of Industry Taufiq Bawazier, MMSGI - Founfers Andrew Hidayat, MMSGI - CEO Sendy Greti, MMSGI Director Yohan Purnama and community leaders in Balikpapan.

KIK has a strategic location because it is located in Balikpapan Bay which is directly facing the Makassar Strait which is part of the Indonesian Archipelagic Sea Lanes (ALKI II), this strategic position makes it easy to mobilize goods for domestic and foreign destinations (export-import). This is supported by the depth of the sea in Balikpapan Bay which can be traversed by ships with a capacity of 50,000 tons. The Kariangau Industrial Estate was built to accommodate the development of the chemical, coal, wood processing, oil drilling, fertilizer and various other industries. Until now, there are around 20 factories that have obtained permits to build factories, of which 13 are already operating, absorbing around 4,000 workers. Companies that are already operating include those engaged in CPO (Crude Palm Oil) processing, mining, coal and oil and gas, shipping industry, metal industry, wood textiles, and warehousing. In carrying out its functions, the Kariangau Industrial Estate is supported by container terminal infrastructure, power plants, access roads, bridges and toll roads.\nThe construction of the Kariangau international container terminal for container loading and unloading activities, general cargo, including coal, with an investment value of Rp. 713 billion occupies an area of around 57.5 ha. The terminal capacity is capable of accommodating 17,000 TEUs (twenty-foot equivalent units) of containers or around 17.5 million tonnes per year. Currently, the construction of a 282 m trestle with a width of 10.5 m has been completed, while the construction of a 1.5 km wharf is under construction. The Kariangau Container Terminal has a depth of 14 m at low tide so it can accommodate large ships weighing up to 22,000 DWT (Dead Weight Tonnes).\"\n\n(Sya'rawie, 6/29/2022, kalimantan.bisnis.com): Manuntung Sukses Balikpapan Regional Public Company ( Perumda) collaborates with a State-Owned Enterprise (BUMN) in the development of the Kariangau Industrial Area (KIK). \n\"The managing director of Perumda Manuntung Sukses Balikpapan Andi Sangkuru stated that the KIK development planning collaboration has been going on since March 2022. \"Progress is still in the planning stage, later we will coordinate with the DPPR (Department of Land and Spatial Planning) and the Licensing Office of the City of Balikpapan for a review, who knows if there are any changes to the RDTR,\" he said, quoted on Wednesday (29/6/2022).\"",

Currently, the IMIP land is fully occupied by 40 tenants from various industrial clusters. \nJust so you know, IMIP manages a nickel-based industrial area that is integrated with the main products in the form of nickel, stainless steel and carbon steel. Supporting industries range from coal power plants, manganese, silicon, chrome, lime, coke and others. There are also port and airport facilities available.\n\"We don't want any more tenants on IMIP's already 4,000 hectares of land. Then adding clean water is already difficult because there are regulations on how much can be taken from the river. \"Apart from that, there are 97,000 employees, almost 7,000 Foreign Workers (TKA), not to mention the whole community,\" he explained when met at the Kompas Gramedia Tower, Tuesday (3/10). \nOn the other hand, continued Barus, his party also wants to fix and improve environmental, social and governance aspects or commonly known as ESG (Environmental, Social and Governance) terminology at IMIP. \nAccording to him, so far IMIP operations have been going well with the presence of 40 tenants. The Morowali industrial area has also invested almost US$ 20 billion to date. Barus emphasized that IMIP will no longer expand land even though there are new tenants who want to go there. \n\"So if you ask, how many tenants are there who just want to come. But there's no land, so don't worry. \"Just to Indonesia Weda Bay Industrial Park (IWIP), after all IWIP is also our partner,\" he added. \nBarus revealed that currently IMIP's electricity demand has almost reached 7,000 Megawatts or the equivalent of 7 GW. Until now, the industrial area is still powered by electricity from coal plants (PLTU) because it is considered a competitive energy source.\nHe said that previously there were parties who offered gas as an alternative energy source at IMIP. However, after going through management calculations, the gas price did not make economic sense. Therefore, Barus stated, IMIP will combine electricity sources from PLTU and Solar Power Plants (PLTS) of 200 MWp.\" \n\n(Antara News, 6/21/2023, en.antaranews.com): Government devising development plan for Morowali Industrial Area\n\"The Public Works and Public Housing Ministry is currently formulating a master plan for regional development, which also covers Central Sulawesi's Morowali Industrial Area.\n“The City Infrastructure Master Plan formulation supporting five strategic industries is (based on a) directive from the Public Works and Public Housing Ministry.

Tsingshan Group is the largest company in the world in the field of nickel processing and has mastered complete processing technology with advanced and modern technology.\"\n\n(Ginting & Moore, 11/22/2021, thepeoplesmap.net):\n\"The Indonesia Morowali Industrial Park (IMIP) was initially built for the purpose of developing nickel pig iron and stainless-steel production, but with the rise of the electric vehicle market, the park’s focus expanded to take advantage of the emergence of nickel as a critical mineral in the renewable energy transition. Construction of the park, in Morowali Regency, Central Sulawesi, began in 2013, and it is now the largest nickel-based industrial area in Indonesia, with 11 smelters. However, this massive development has a significant ecological footprint through submarine wastewater disposal and air pollution from coal-generated power.\n[IMIP] Project Impacts:\nWater Pollution and Biodiversity Loss: Pollution and wastewater runoff from the park have impacted water quality, decreasing the numbers of fish and other marine life and forcing fishers to travel further out to sea. Proposed plans for deep-sea tailings disposal raised serious environmental concerns but applications were later withdrawn by the company.\nAir Pollution: Emissions from the plants powering the park are increasing air pollution and causing respiratory illnesses in surrounding populations.\nDeforestation: Rates of deforestation rose in the years following the Indonesian Government’s ban on resource exports and the start of construction of the IMIP in 2013.\nMilitarisation: The IMIP is designated a National Strategic Project (NSP), and to protect the investment, the police presence has already increased in the vicinity and an additional military presence is planned.\nLabour: Workers lack labour protections and face job instability, low wages, and workplace safety hazards.\nLocal Community: Despite the jobs created in the park, most local people remain engaged in agriculture as they do not have the skills or desire to work in industrial projects. A decline in government investment in agricultural projects, coupled with environmental impacts from the IMIP, has caused hardship for farmers.\"",

[1]\nThe estate is publicly owned and operated. Tenants include companies in the food processing and manufacturing industries. They enjoy various tax and regulatory incentives, as well as access to transportation infrastructure.\nHistory of the Zone\nIn 1988, the Indonesian government created the Makassar Industrial Estate.[2]\nThe estate was created at a time of rapid economic growth in Indonesia. President Suharto, who governed Indonesia from 1968 until 1998, made significant reforms to the economy. Indonesia’s GDP grew from $7 billion USD in 1968 to $84 billion USD in 1988.\nIn the late 1980s, the Indonesian government passed several reforms to increase exports such as devaluing the currency. Notably, in 1989, the government created SEZ-style “Industrial Estates.” Restrictions on foreign investment within the estates were relaxed. The reforms were successful.[5] The GDP per capita of Indonesia grew 550% during the 1990s, and annual GDP growth averaged at 7%.[6]\nPlans for the Makassar Industrial Estate go as far back as 1975, with the growth of the business park mostly occurring in the 1990s and early 2000s. The estate started producing cacao and flour in the early 2000s.[15]\nIn April 2019, the Makassar New Port opened several kilometers from the estate.[2] Recently there have been plans to expand zone because most of the existing plots have already been sold out.[4]\nNotable Tenants\nAs of 2020, there are 270 businesses operating within the industrial estate, 27 of which are Japanese companies.[2] The tenants belong to the following industries: seafood processing, cold storage, animal feed, and agricultural processing.[2]\nOne notable tenant is Indofood, one of Indonesia’s largest food processors. Another notable tenant is Plastindo, a large plastic packaging manufacturer.\nManagement of the Zone\n‍The Makassar Industrial Estate is managed by Kawasan Industri Makassar (KIMA).\nKIMA is a state owned enterprise which manages Makassar as well as several other industrial estates on the island of Sulawesi.[1] 60% of the company is owned by the Indonesian government, the Government of South Sulawesi owns 30% of the shares, and the remaining 10% is owned by the Makassar city government.[2] It is regulated by the Indonesian Ministry of State Owned Enterprises.[1]\nMain Incentives\n‍The laws that currently govern the Makassar Industrial estate are Law 39 from 2009 and Government Regulation 40 from 2021.[2][7][8][9]\nCompanies located in the zone can take advantage of the following incentives:\nThe ability to write off various investments from the corporate income tax\nAccelerated depreciation and amortization of assets\nA 10% tax on dividends\nStreamlined import / export regulations\nEasy access to business VISAs\n0% interest rates on loans for land purchases\nThe minimum wage for tenants has been reduced from 4.4 million IDR / month ($305) to 2.9 million IDR ($200)\nKIMA (the management company) will handle environmental impact assessments\n‍Infrastructure\n‍As of early 2020, the zone covers an area of 336 hectares, although there are plans for expansion.[2] The estate provides electricity, clean water, telecommunications, medical clinics, warehouses, and has a fire station. The estate also helps its tenants with construction by providing transportation or rental of equipment. The park is also the only industrial area in Sulawesi that has a liquid waste treatment process.[10]‍\nAs for location, the zone is 5 km away from the Sultan Hasanuddin International Airport, 18 km away from the Soekarno Hatta Seaport, 7.6 km away from the train station, and 1.8 km away from the main road.[2]\nCorporate Social Responsibilities\n‍The Makassar Industrial Estate’s management company, KIMA, has created various corporate social responsibility programs.[12] These include:\n-KIMA Green, a program that seeks to reduce air pollution by planting trees and reducing tenant emissions\n-Financing for local entrepreneurs\n-An Educational Assistance Program\n-​​A Free Rice ATM which gives ATM cards to the community that can be used to withdraw 5 liters of free rice every 2 weeks\nEffects of COVID-19\nFor the few months of the pandemic, the estate had difficulties importing raw materials for processing. The breakdown of the global supply chain caused many tenants to be starved for inputs.[14] Consequently, KIMA suffered financially. The park’s financial performance in 2020 dropped compared to their performanced in 2018. Net profit in 2020 had shrunk by 10% compared to the previous year.[13]\nPlanned Expansion\n‍In early 2019, the Ministry of Investment announced that they would expand the zone from 336 hectares to 1000 hectares. Existing plots were almost entirely sold out, and the estate found itself unable to accommodate new investors seeking to enter. A second location, called KIMA 2, is scheduled to be built elsewhere in the city Makassar.[11] The Makassar Industrial Estate is also working to modernize its logistics systems.\nConclusion\n‍The Makassar Industrial Estate is one of Indonesia’s fastest growing SEZs, and will likely continue playing a major role in the region over the next decade.\"  ",

Andalas Rekasindo Pratama (ARP) was assessed by the Indonesian BPK as disorderly. This puts the provincial government at risk of losing 108 hectares of land assets and not receiving dividends. PT ARP in its journey later developed into PT. PIP.\nThis is a record of problems in the financial management of the West Sumatra government which were assessed by the Republic of Indonesia's BPK regarding the 2022 West Sumatra regional government financial report (LKPD).\nMember V of BPK RI, Ahmad Noor Supit, said that the 108 hectare land was an asset invested by the Provincial Government.\n\"This asset is at risk of being lost and the West Sumatra Government is also at risk of not receiving a contribution to income in the form of dividends and income from the process of changing management rights (HPL) to building use rights (HGB) from land sales by PT. Padang Industrial Park (PIP),\" said Ahmad in Padang while attending the plenary meeting for the handover of the LHP BPK at the West Sumatra DPRD, Friday (19/5).\nAhmad added that in accordance with article 20 of Law Number 15 of 2004 concerning Audits of Management and Responsibility of State Finances, it is mandated that officials are obliged to follow up on recommendations from audit reports.\nIn addition, officials are required to provide answers or explanations to the BPK regarding follow-up actions to recommendations from audit reports.\n\"The answer or explanation referred to is submitted to the BPK no later than 60 days after the audit report is received,\" he said.\nBased on monitoring data on follow-up recommendations from BPK audit results, up to the 2022 Semester II Monitoring Report, the West Sumatra Provincial Government has followed up on 1,477 recommendations out of 2,066 recommendations or 71.49 percent of the total recommendations for the 2005 - 2022 period. Thus there are still 587 recommendations ( 28.41 percent) which must be a priority for immediate action, and 2 recommendations (0.10 percent) which cannot be followed up.\n\"I hope that the DPRD leadership and members can participate in monitoring the completion of the follow-up to the recommendations from the examination results contained in this LHP in accordance with their authority,\" explained Ahmad.\nFor your information, initially the West Sumatra Provincial Government together with other parties established PT Andalas Rekasindo Pratama (ARP).\nIn establishing the company, the West Sumatra provincial government deposited land assets of 108 hectares with a share composition of 55 percent.\nThen along the way, a joint venture was carried out with a company from Johor Malaysia which gave birth to PT. Padang Industrial Park (PIP).\nIn 2014 the West Sumatra DPRD formed a special committee to settle West Sumatra assets in PIP. The special committee's recommendation asks the provincial government to encourage the implementation of an extraordinary GMS to determine the status of the provincial government's capital participation in PT. ARP. However, until now the provincial government has not followed up on the recommendations.\nThere were several recommendations made at that time. Among them, ensuring provincial government assets are in PIP. Apart from the number of provincial government shares there and also the amount of land.\nThen there is also a recommendation to seek certainty and truth regarding the capital participation from TPM Technopark SDN BHD amounting to USD 3,300,000. The DPRD believes it is necessary to find out what the funds were used for.\nThe DPRD also asked the provincial government to carry out an inventory of 108 hectares of land as capital investment for PT. ARP at PT. PIP which is also an equalization of the capital of the West Sumatra Provincial Government in PT. ARP.\nThen he was also asked to carry out an inventory of 35.5 hectares of land which was purchased from TPM Technopark SDN BHD capital investment funds. Due to the purchase of this amount of land, the provincial government was asked to carry out a financial audit of PT. PIP.\"\n\n(Fajar Sumbar, 10/20/2021, FajarSumbar.com): \"Provincial Government of West Sumatra prepared a team to investigate the status of Padang Industrial Park.

French mining group Eramet acquired the Canadian stake in 2006, and planned to develop the site, but due to low mineral prices the project was put on hold in 2013. In 2017, China's Tsingshan Group signed an agreement, giving it a 57% stake in Weda Bay Minerals, and giving Tsingshan the responsibility to develop mineral processing while Eramet retained its mining operations. Construction of the industrial park began in April 2018, with mining operations commencing in October 2019 and metallurgical production in April 2020.[1]\nAs of 2020, four nickel ferroalloy production lines are active in the industrial park, with undergoing development of a cobalt-nickel refining complex.[1] A nickel sulphate plant is also slated for construction in the park.[2]\"",

The reason is, until now there has been no significant progress. What can be seen is only the construction of the Pekanbaru Pemko offices and the Tenayan PLTU. In fact, it is said that KIT will become a new icon and is promised for the welfare of the people of Pekanbaru, especially for employment and business. \"To what extent the progress of the accelerated development is, we don't know yet. This is of course a question, since 2018, if I'm not mistaken, this is the story,\" said Pekanbaru City DPRD Commission IV member Ruslan Tarigan.

However, according to him, there are several factors that must be resolved. Such as the problem of the Covid-19 case which resulted in the KIT management process being hampered. Added to this is the unclear land issue, as well as the infrastructure that is not yet visible. There are already many investors who want to enter to invest in KIT, but with this pandemic condition, they prefer to wait until an unspecified time. \"It's not that there has been no progress. But there are several issues that must be resolved first, land, infrastructure, and also Covid-19,\" he said, Friday (18/6). He revealed that now the Covid-19 case in Pekanbaru is high, even since he first entered Pekanbaru. Finally, the investors discouraged their intention to cooperate. Heri emphasized that he did not agree if it was said that the management of KIT was running in place or was just making a fuss. His party continues to work every day and communicate intensively with potential investors. \"With the current conditions they (investors, red) still don't want to invest in this area, so what else can we do,\" he said. Heri explained, in this KIT there are still problems that have not been resolved until now. Land legality, this is a big question from all incoming investors. Because until now, his party is still waiting for the HPL of the land. And the most important thing right now, Heri determined, what needs to be done is to prepare basic regional infrastructure, such as clean water supply, WWTP, environmental roads and so on. \"To prepare this requires a fairly large budget of around IDR 1.8 trillion,\" he explained. However, Heri emphasized that his party was still working and conveyed the results to Wako. (yls)\"",

This step is aimed at attracting investors for coal gasification projects into Dimethyl Ether (DME).\nThe gasification project is estimated to be able to produce 1.4 million tons of DME per year from 6 million tons of 4,200 calorie coal. However, this project stalled after the gas and chemical processing company from the United States (US), Air Products and Chemicals Inc, withdrew as the primary investor. The project worth IDR 34.04 trillion will also produce 2.1 million tons of methanol per year and Syngas or synthetic gas of 4.5 million kN/m3 per year. \"We propose that the Tanjung Enim Industrial Area be designated as a KEK in order to obtain incentives for investors who contribute to the development of coal downstreaming,\" said PTBA Corporate Secretary , Apollonius Andwie, via short message on Friday (5/5).\nThe KEK in question is an integrated industrial area covering an area of ​​585 hectares in Tanjung Enim. The area, named 'Bukit Asam Coal-Based Industrial Estate', is projected to become a center for downstream and energy-based industries.\nIt is hoped that the establishment of a special economic zone will attract investor capital by offering incentives provided by the government. The special land is intended for the development of downstream industries in collaboration with potential partners. In addition, PTBA has allocated special coal reserves for downstream projects, so that coal needs for the downstream industry can be guaranteed. \"With strong support from the government, PTBA is optimistic that coal downstreaming will be realized,\" said Apollo.\nMinister of Energy and Mineral Resources Arifin Tasrif revealed that Air Products and Chemicals Inc. withdrew from two coal downstream projects with PT Bukit Asam due to the change in the company's business direction to become a hydrogen developer in its home country, the United States (US). Air Products' maneuver was also motivated by the US Government's policy of supporting the development of new and renewable energy (EBT) by providing subsidies to projects being carried out, especially hydrogen development.\n\"Because the US is encouraging the use of hydrogen, they feel that business in the US is more attractive. In the US there are subsidies for EBT, there are more interesting projects for hydrogen,\" said Arifin when met at the Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources office on Friday (17/3). This is regulated in the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) or the Inflation Reduction Act which was issued in August 2022. Through the IRA, the US government disbursed US$ 369 billion to maintain national energy security while reducing the impact of climate change. The IRA also arranges easy investment credit for the development of hydrogen storage projects and technologies. \"This is what causes many investors to flee to the US,\" said Arifin.\"\n\n(Arief, 11/28/2022, merdeka.com): \"President Director of PT Bukit Asam Tbk Arsal Ismail said his party is still waiting for a Presidential Regulation (Perpres) which is still in the drafting stage, for the coal gasification project to Dimethyl Ether (DME). This downstream project is targeted to be completed in 2027.\nThis project is handled by 3 companies, namely PTBA as a coal supplier, PT Pertamina as an offtaker, and a company from the United States Air Products as a processing and technology provider.\n\"Now, the most important point for us is the regulation. Until now, the draft presidential regulation has been discussed by the relevant ministries and this is one of the necessary conditions that we must fulfill so that this project can accelerate the DME,\" said Arsal in the Commission VII DPR RI Hearing Meeting with PTBA, Monday (28/11).\nThis Presidential Decree is one of the 6 points of coal gasification progress. In the first stage, his party has signed the Cooperation Agreement for the Coal to DME project. Currently, the process is awaiting signature from Pertamina Patra Niaga.\nThen, his party is also carrying out a site investigation by Air Product Company Indonesia (APCI) and discussing land cost side agreements. Currently, a geotechnical survey has been carried out at the Coal to DME project site.\n\"We have also done and are currently doing this and address readiness in the field. Of course, we and Air Products as a processing company are conducting an assessment of the technical specifications for land preparation at the Coal to DME project site. We are doing this in detail, because that is the location. the land generally contains coal,\" continued Arsal.\nIn terms of carrying out sampling and analysis of Banko Tengah A coal specifications, his party has drilled at 32 points until November 2022. With a target of completing drilling at 7 points by December 2022.\n\"We have also carried out coal sampling and analysis of coal specifications which we are focusing on in the Banko Tengah A block. We have and are doing this and we have done it.

A 2014 research paper by Mustika Septiyas Trisilia confirms the location and tenants operational at the industrial park. However, it is possible that the industrial park is no longer included as an industrial park in strategic planning documents or now goes by a different names, as news articles past 2016 do not seem to refer Kawasan Industri Lampung as an industrial area in Lampung, and instead focus on the development of new industrial parks in the area.\n\n(Development Strategy of Lampung Industrial Region, n.d., 123dok.com): \n\"The Lampung Industrial Area is located on Jalan Ir. Sutami Km. 15 Sindangsari Village, Tanjung Bintang, South Lampung, has been designated in the Tata Macro Plan Room Number 1 of 2010 and in vertical downward implementation is supported in the Micro Spatial Plan for South Lampung Regency.

Composition shares consist of the Central Government 12.36%, the Lampung Provincial Government 4.64% and PT Lampung Sentosa Industrial Estate 75%. Since 1990, the Lampung Industrial Area has been reserved for plantation areas owned by PT Perkebunan Nusantara VII (Persero), can only manage an area of ​​126.8 part of the HGU Certificate belonging to PT. Perkebunan Nusantara VII (Persero). \nIn table 3, it is known that there are eleven industries in the area the. Of the eleven companies, LIPI Lampung owns the land with a maximum area of ​​120,000 m2 engaged in iron ore smelting, next PT. Central Pertiwi Bahari which has an area of ​​109,730 m2 operates in the field of providing shrimp feed. Meanwhile, companies that having the least land is PT. PGN with an area of ​​6000 m2.

KAIL, namely becoming a modern, strategic, industrial area sustainable, reputable and environmentally friendly, the management trying to complete the facilities and infrastructure in the area. At the moment, 7 Konstin 2,730 m long, type S.III drainage 3,095 m long, network telephone for 550 ss, two fire hydrants, electricity network and 150 KV substation with 2x30 MVA power, Mercury street lighting, clean water facilities with a capacity of 30 lt/sec.\nApart from adequate infrastructure, this area also has a good location strategic, namely having a distance of 14 km to Bandarlampung and to the export port 20 km long. However, there are some damage to five road sections in KAIL with a length of 58 km, starting from Sutami, Bergen, Pugungraharjo, Sribhawono, and Simpang Sribhawono. From Of the total length of the road, 44.8% or 26 km of it is seriously damaged. This damage results in long and costly traffic jams.\nThere are several planned activities that will be carried out by KAIL, namely:\n1. Plan, build and develop industrial areas for use prepare land areas, facilities and infrastructure, as well as industrial facilities other things needed by investors.\n2. Carry out management and maintenance activities for the area industry.\n3. Providing and selling industrial land plots.\n4. Services in the form of consulting services, development services, warehousing services, services supervision.\n5. Providing Bonded Zones (EPZ) for industrial companies\n6.

Although there are no specific regulations regarding the Lampung Industrial Area yet there is, but the government has carried out several supporting activities KAIL's developments, such as repairing several roads connecting KAIL to centers of economic activity and sources of raw materials and The government is also trying to acquire 173.44 hectares of land which de jure and civil matters are still part of the HGU Certificate owned by PT. Perkebunan Nusantara VII (Persero). \nFacilities and infrastructure are almost adequate in the area, not necessarily make this area developed and developed. This has been proven over the years 1998-2014 with a total of 126 hectares of land available, there were only 11 companies in the area with a total area of ​​494,490 m2.\"\n\n(Lampung Tribune Print, 10/31/2014, lampung.tribunnews.com): \"Efforts to establish an integrated industrial area in Lampung have been carried out by the Lampung Provincial Government (Pemprov) since 2008. Even so, the area which was later called the Lampung Industrial Area (Kail), is still stagnant or has not experienced significant developments to date.\nLampung DPRD member Watoni Nurdin said the DPRD had submitted a revision to a regional regulation (perda) related to the legal basis for the management of the area by PT Kail. This was because Kail's development did not run optimally.\n\"Discussion on the revision of the 2012 regional regulations. From 2008 to 2012, PT Kail has never held a GMS (general meeting of shareholders). In fact, the GMS is one of them to make development plans. How can you proceed if you haven't even held a GMS,\" said Watoni, Thursday (30/10).\nPT Kail is a consortium consisting of PT Lestari Sentosa Industrial Estate (LSIE, Sungai Budi Group), the central government, and the Provincial Government of Lampung. The three elements each have shares of 75 percent, 20 percent and 4 percent.\nAccording to Watoni, the reason why the management of PT Kail has not held a GMS is because they have not received a recommendation from the Minister of State-Owned Enterprises (BUMN). \"But when the DPRD came to the Ministry of BUMN to confirm this, one of the director generals (Director General) at the ministry said it was not necessary. And the management of PT Kail has never submitted it to the ministry. How can a recommendation be dropped,\" said Watoni, who is also a member the special committee (pansus) for the revision of PT Kail's regional regulations in the DPRD for the 2009-2014 period.\nKail's condition, continued Watoni, did not even meet the requirements to become an industrial area. This is because supporting infrastructure for industrial activities has not been fulfilled, such as electricity networks, sewage channels, or road networks.\n\"In fact, there are no land plots for placing companies yet. The 300 hectares of land has not been added. He said, additional land is still a problem with PTPN. In fact, only 126 hectares have just been managed. Now, the area exists. However, it doesn't exist,\" said Indonesian Democratic Party of Struggle (PDIP) politician.\nAs a result of these conditions, Watoni revealed, the revision of the regional regulation failed to be finalized. The DPRD then wrote to the Governor of Lampung to replace the management of PT Kail. This is because the DPRD assesses that the current management of PT Kail has defaulted.\"",

A source in November 2023 (Babel Today) speculated that the project had stalled.\n\n(Babel Today, 11/14/2023, babeltoday.com): What's The News About The Sadai Industrial Area Project Worth Trillions? Billions Of State Funds Are At Risk Of Being 'Wasted' For Nothing\n\"Now there is almost no news about the development or progress of the Sadai Industrial Area (KIS) or Sadai Integrated Industrial and Port Estate (SIIPE) development project in the Sadai Village area, Tukak Sadai District, South Bangka Regency (Basel).\nIn fact, previously Justiar Noer, when he was still the Regent of Babel, admitted that he was very optimistic regarding plans in the Basel Regency area to build a project worth trillions of rupiah in an industrial area in the Sadai area, Basel which was predicted to cost hundreds of trillions and was targeted for completion in next 2024.\nApart from that, if this mega project is realized it is hoped that it can absorb hundreds of workers. Moreover, in the implementation of the construction of the KIS project, it was reported that the Bangka Belitung Islands High Prosecutor's Office (Kejati Babel) was actually the Strategic Project Development Security Team (TPPPS).\nIt is also known that in the KIS Basel project managed by PT RBA there are at least 25 main programs including the construction of ship barriers, electronics factories, tin smelting industry (semester), rare earth metal processing factories (rear earth), glass industry, tin waste, white pepper processing factory, container terminal and fuel oil (BBM) depot as well as B3 waste processing factory.\nHowever, on the contrary, some parties, including the public, still doubt or doubt that this mega project can be realized because it is considered that the Basel Regency Government's APBD is inadequate and this hope now seems to be just a 'dream' that must be felt by itself.\nSo far, Justiar Noer has ended his position as Regent of South Bangka and is currently running as a DPD-RI candidate for the Bangka Belitung electoral district for the period 2024 – 2029.\nSadly, it is now reported that the KIS mega project is no longer running smoothly, aka 'stalled', because the private company or developer or manager of the KIS project, namely PT Ration Bangka Abadi (RBA), is currently allegedly facing problems. So what is the fate of the KIS mega project now?\nMeanwhile, information gathered by the Bangka Belitung Online News Agency (KBO Babel) team in the field as well as information from a number of sources stated that especially in the KIS project development activities, the Basel Regency Government facilitated the provision of more than 400 hectares (ha) of land for the development of KIS.\n* State projects worth billions are even built on privately owned land\nHowever, other news also states that in the implementation of the construction of the KIS project or National Strategic Project, which was built in 2018, it is suspected that there have been errors or deviations, including regarding the status of the land as a location for work activities for the construction of raw water supply facilities or Resevoir Water Systems carried out under the auspices of Ministry of PUPR PJSA Working Unit for Bangka Belitung Region and PT Gala Karya – PT Graha Anugerah Lestari.\nIt is known that the project activity for raw water supply facilities or Reservoir Air System has a total funding ceiling of IDR 75,446,927,000,- or more than IDR 75.4 billion, sourced from APBN funds for the 2023 Fiscal Year (FY). KIS, Tukak Sadai., Toboali. The implementation was carried out by the PUPR Ministry, Directorate General of Water Data Resources, Bangka Belitung River Regional Office (BWS)\n\"The information is that the land status or location for the construction of the Reservoir Air System was built on land owned by PT RBA. Well, if the government wants to build this project (Reservoir Air System — ed), the land status must belong to the state and not private land. \"Unless a grant has been made, it must be done through a notarial deed,\" said this source to the KBO Babel team recently met in Sadai.\nNot only that, at the KIS location, according to this source, it is also suspected that there have been irregularities in implementation or procedures, including, among other things, project activities for the construction of a B3 waste processing plant. This waste factory has now been built at the KIS location. However, the location for the construction of this waste factory was actually built on land still owned by PT RBA.\nThis source continued that regarding the implementation of work on the construction of the Reservoir Air System, it does not rule out the possibility that it will be threatened with being discovered by the Indonesian Financial Audit Agency (BPK) because it is suspected that there have been irregularities in the use of finances or the state budget.\nPreviously, it was reported that a team from the Indonesian Ministry of Public Works and Public Housing (PUPR), Thursday (14/11/2023) had visited the location of the Sadai Industrial Area (KIS) raw water supply project in Tukak Sadai District. The PUPR Ministry team was also accompanied by the Bangka Belitung Islands Prosecutor's Office and the South Bangka Prosecutor's Office.\n* Asked about the KIS project, the former Regent of Basel admitted that he was focused on running for DPD-RI\nRegarding the issue of the KIS development project, Tukak Sadai Basel, the KBO Babel team tried to contact the former Regent of Basel, Justiar Noer via short message/What's App (WA), Saturday (11/11/2023) afternoon but he answered flatly. He even stated that he is currently focused on preparing himself to run as a candidate for DPD-RI 2024-2029.\n\"Regarding Sadai (KIS - ed.), I haven't received any further information yet, I haven't had time to meet Agek's friends, now I'm busy with visits to friends for plans for the DPD RI legislative elections,\" Justiar answered briefly.\nLikewise, when the KBO Babel team tried to confirm the progress of the KIS Basel development to the Regent of Basel, Reza Herdavid via WA message, Saturday (11/11/2023) evening he admitted that he did not know.\nIn fact, it is known that when the construction of the KiS Basel project began in 2020, Reza Herdavid was still serving as Deputy Regent of Basel.\n\"I'm not monitoring, bro,\" replied Reza briefly.\nNext, the KBO Babel team also tried to visit the office of the SNVT Working Unit for the Implementation of the Bangka Belitung Water Utilization Network (PJSA) Bangka Belitung River Region Hall, Ministry of PUPR, Monday (11/13/2023) afternoon. However, unfortunately the head of this agency was not there that afternoon.\nMeanwhile, Franky Alais Acai, Field Head of PT RBA, confirmed the progress of the KIS Basel development project, according to him, until now development activities are still ongoing. In fact, according to him, at the KIS location currently a B3 waste processing plant and a biomass power plant (PLTBM) have been built.\n“Activities for the construction of the Sadai industrial area (KIS — ed) are currently still ongoing, sir. There is already construction at the KIS location, namely a B3 waste processing factory and PLTBM. \"And other work is currently underway, namely road construction work,\" said Franky when contacted via his cellphone, Monday (13/11/2023) afternoon.\nIt is known that the project activity for building a B3 waste processing plant at the KIS location is a project of the central Ministry of Environment & Activities (KLHK) and also involves Regional Owned Enterprises (BUMD) of the Babel Provincial Government.\nWhen work began on building the B3 waste processing factory, the Director of BUMD (PT Bumi Bangka Belitung Sejahtera), Prof. Safarudin.\nHowever, when Safarudin was confirmed by the KBO Babel team regarding the KIS Basel project activities involving the BUMD of the Babel Provincial Government, he admitted that at this time he did not know anything.\n\"I'm sorry, I'm no longer at BUMD Babel, and I'm also not involved in the Sadai Industrial Zone anymore. \"So I don't know any more information about KIS,\" he replied in a WA message Monday (13/11/2023) evening.\nLikewise, when asked about the status of the land where the B3 waste factory was now built at the KIS location, he even admitted that the factory land was a grant.\n\"The land for the construction of the B3 waste factory was a grant from PT RBA to the Babel Provincial Government,\" he said. It was again asked whether there was any evidence that the land received a grant. However, Udin, as this man was known, did not answer. Instead, Udin explained something else. “Then BUMD is not implementing the project. \"The implementation is the Central Ministry of Environment,\" he said.\nSeparately, the Head of Legal Information (Penkum) of the Babel Prosecutor's Office, Basuki Raharjo SH MH, confirmed that the KIS development project activities in Tukak Sadai Village, Sadai District, South Bangka Regency were part of the Babel Prosecutor's Office as the PPPS team. However, Basuki admitted that he had not received this information.\n\"Sorry, haven't received any information?\" Basuki answered briefly via WA message received, Monday (11/13/2023) afternoon.\n\n(Tempo, 1/27/2023, bisnis.tempo.co): \"According to Vindyarto, the second stage of infrastructure that was built by his party at KI Sadai includes ports, water treatment or clean water, regional waste management, area management offices, port management offices, container terminals and warehousing.\n\"Our target is that in 2024 all infrastructure built on a 400 hectare land area will be completed. Currently, only one industry is operating, namely a hospital waste treatment plant.

Because of this, infrastructure development is needed to prepare raw water sources as a provider of clean water in the area. As an effort to accelerate the preparation of this infrastructure, the Acting Governor of the Bangka Belitung Islands (Kep. Babel), Ridwan Djamaluddin attended a Coordination Meeting (Rakor) for Raw Water Preparation in the Sadai Industrial Area, in the Meeting Room Lt. 16, Coordinating Ministry for Maritime Affairs and Investment, Jalan M.H Thamrin No. 8, Menteng, Central Jakarta, Tuesday (29/11/2022).\"\n\n(Dahnur & Putri, 10/26/2022, regional.kompas.com): \"A land area of ​​400 hectares is prepared to support the Sadai Integrated Industrial and Port Estate (SIIPE) or the Sadai industrial area in South Bangka , Bangka Belitung Islands. The construction, which is included in the second phase of the 2022 national strategic priority project, was accelerated after last week's visit by President Joko Widodo. Main Director of Management of the Sadai Industrial Area , Yanto Purba, said that the infrastructure at the southern end of Bangka will reduce the burden on the Pangkalbalam port in Pangkalpinang City. SIIPE will also serve various commodities from South Bangka such as tin and palm products. \"We estimate that phase two will be fully completed before 2024. The workforce in this project reaches 700-800 people,\" said Yanto after a meeting of potential investors and stakeholders in Pangkalpinang, Wednesday (26/10/2022).\"\n\n(Babelterkini.com, 4/17/2022, babelterkini.com): \"The Mega Project for the Development of the Sadai Industrial Area and Surrounding Areas (KISS) which is claimed to cost up to 100 (one hundred) trillion in funds, whose construction began in early 2020 with a target of completion in 2024, is likely to be a total failure project. This is because in field observations, Wednesay (12/4/22), there has been no significant progress in the construction of KISS. On the contrary, the condition of the road that used to be level but now is filled with piles of excavated earth on either side of the road. The same goes for building construction. There is not a single building standing in the midle of the area but only a warehouse filled with a number of materials. Meanwhile, a small group of workers were seen a taking a break, not carrying out activities.\"",

In South Sulawesi there are two industrial areas, namely the Bantaeng Industrial Area and the Takalar Industrial Area\nSpecifically, the Takalar Industrial Area (KITA) became a PSN in the second period of President Joko Widodo together with Ma'aruf Amin, who collaborated with the State-Owned Enterprise (BUMN) PT Kawasan Berikat Nusantara (Persero).\nFrom the information gathered, since the last few years PT KBN has developed the Takalar Integrated Industrial Park (TIIP) in Takalar Regency. This industrial area is planned to be built on 3,500 hectares of land with details 2 . 600 hectares for industrial areas, 100 hectares for port areas, 100 hectares for residential and commercial areas, and 45 hectares for golf areas.\nMeanwhile, the industrial area with 1,000 hectares of land will later be converted into a non-ferrous metal processing industry and will be carried out in several stages.\nSo what's up with the Takalar Industrial Zone at the moment, ahead of the administration of President Joko Widodo and Vice President Ma'aruf Amin, where this project is included in the 2020-2024 RPJMN and regulated in Presidential Decree 109 of 2020.\nActing Regent of Takalar  Setiawan Aswad admitted that the progress of the Industrial Zone did not show anything positive, it was hampered by land licensing issues, in this case the transfer of assets from the transmigration area to the industrial area, and also the collaboration with KBN ended.\n\"So, what was once hoped to be able to manage the industrial area, until now there has been no progress, because the location permit and cooperation issues have ended,\" said Setiawan, recently.\nFor this reason, Setiawan stated that he had opened new communications with investors and was currently conducting assessments, including with the community in three villages related to the land there.\n\"We have also visited the respective communities in   the villages of Laikang, Punaga and Cikoang which are included in the industrial area, so that later when construction starts there will be no problems,\" he said.\nSetiawan targets   to start acquiring around 100-200 hectares of land first.\nMeanwhile, the Head of the South Sulawesi Province Industry and Trade Service, Ahmadi Akil, admitted that the collaboration with the third party, in this case KBN, had ended.\nAhmadi explained that with the expiry of the previous investor agreement with the regional government, it meant it could not continue. \"Once it has ended it cannot be continued, because there is no extension and I see that the Takalar Regency Government has proposed new investors to continue development of the industrial area,\" he explained.\nCurrently, Ahmadi stated that the proposal had been followed up with the Ministry of Industry, so that it could receive approval (*)\"\n\n(Fajar Daily, 2/3/2022, harian.fajar.co.id): \"Takalar will be 62 years old, next Thursday, February 10.

The first stage requires 1,000 hectares of land. Currently, the Takalar Regency Government has provided 750 hectares of land.\nThe industrial area is estimated to absorb a workforce of 15 thousand people. Apart from that, this integrated area will focus on the aluminum and copper processing industry.\nTakalar Regency is considered to have the potential to become a metal industrial area with a number of aspects being fulfilled. Among other things, it is a strategic area with a distance from Makassar Port of around 25 kilometers.\nApart from that, Takalar has a geographical area with coastal and waterfront areas which can be used as land for special port development .

The two parties have yet to reach an agreement regarding the royalty collection scheme for coal production.\nBob Kamandanu, Main Director of Delma Mining Corporation, said that until now the coal mining company and the government have not signed a contract amendment memorandum of understanding (MoU). This is because there are differing views regarding the royalty withdrawal point of 13.5% of the selling price...For your information, Delma Mining is included in group 12 out of 73 companies holding coal mining concession agreements (PKP2B) that have not signed an MoU on contract amendments to date. The company is a PKP2B generation III, which has a mining area of ​​20,160 hectares (ha) in North Kalimantan.\"\n\n(Nugroho, 1/10/2012, ekonomi.bisnis.com): \"President Director of Delma Mining Bob Kamandanu said the company's mine which is located in Bulungan Regency, East Kalimantan is currently still under construction, namely still building infrastructure and mining business facilities. \"The production plan is in the second half of this year. Currently there are still problems with land acquisition. Out of our 20,160 hectares of land, it doesn't mean that we can all mine there because there are lots of people's lands,\" he said when contacted by Bisnis today. Delma Mining is one of 12 Coal Mining Work Agreements (PKP2B) which are currently still in the construction stage and not yet in production. Since the PKP2B was signed on November 20, 1997, it means that it took almost 15 years for Delma to carry out production. The process towards production, continued Bob, took a lot of time starting from the exploration period for the first 5 years to delaying production considering that the company's coal products are low in calories, namely 2,800 KKal/Kg (GAR) \"In the past, our total land area was 100,000 hectares, now it is only 20,160 hectares after the exploration process and so on. After [the coal] is known to have low calories, it cannot be marketed yet,\" he said...In addition, in the company's long-term plan, apart from increasing Delma's production, it also plans to increase the added value of coal, such as gasifying coal and building a mine-mouth PLTU. the plan is 2013 and the capacity is not large. We also plan to open an industrial area around the mine,\" said Bob.\"",

The site's general manager, Hao Weisong, said on Tuesday that the company plans a 100-MW solar power facility and has also agreed to buy renewable power from state utility Perusahaan Listrik Negara.\nThe SEZ's operating company, PT Bintan Alumina Indonesia, was last year granted a full waiver of income tax for 20 years, Susiwijono Moegiarso, secretary general of the National Council of Special Economic Zones, said on Friday.\nHe said investment at the site has thus far totalled 17 trillion rupiah ($1.16 billion).\nIndonesian President Joko Widodo, who visited the site last year, is focusing on minerals processing to extract more value from its vast mining sector, and the government may impose an export ban in June on unprocessed minerals, including bauxite.\nMoegiarso said that the SEZ has committed to supplying 33.8% of its power from renewable sources by 2032.\"\n\n(Panama, 2/25/2023, kepri.antaranews.com): Investment realization in the Galang Batang Bintan SEZ reached IDR 19 trillion\n\"The government of Bintan Regency, Riau Archipelago, noted that investment realization in the Galang Batang Special Economic Zones (KEK) reached IDR 19 trillion in the last three years.\nIndra Hidayat, Head of the Bintan One-Stop Integrated Investment and Licensing Agency, said in Bintan on Friday that the company building the alumina industry in the Galang Batang SEZ continues to develops its business.\nThe business of processing bauxite into alumina power is growing rapidly, marked by production figures increasing from 1 million tons to 2 million tons in early 2023.\n\"\"Alumina power from local bauxite processing is exported to China, India and Malaysia,\"\" he said.\nAccording to him, PT Bintan Alumina Indonesia (BAI), a foreign investment company that manages the Galang Batang SEZ, has not been affected by the COVID-19 pandemic at all. The company continues to develop industrial areas and prepare for various other industries, apart from alumina pulp.\nAt the end of the year, he said, PT Bai will start exploring the alumina bar industry, which will be exported to various countries. Accordingly, the company will build a new steam power plant with a capacity of 1,200 MW.\n\"\"The existing steam power plant with a capacity of 125 MW is not sufficient, so it is being built again with a capacity of 1,200 MW,\"\" he said.\nThe company has also started to crawl to Poto Island, Bintan Pesisir district to develop petrochemical industry businesses, chemical recycling and others. The government has granted a location permit to manage the 1,200 hectares of land on the island.\n\"\"The investment target to be invested reaches IDR 150 trillion,\"\" he said.\nThe number of local workers in the Galang Batang SEZ reaches 3,000 people, while foreign workers who have expertise are as many as 1,000 people.\n\"\"This company certainly needs more workers when the industry on Poto Island is running,\"\" he said.\"\n\n(2/24/2023, hariankepri.com): PT BAI will Build an Ammunition Industry in Bintan and a 1,200 Megawatt PLTU\n\"Management of the Galang Batang Special Economic Zone (KEK), will expand and increase the mineral processing industry (bauxite) and its derivative products in Bintan.\n\"\"For 2023, they will start building an alumina derivate factory, namely, an alumina bar industrial factor,\"\" said Head of PMPTSP Bintan Office, Indra Hidayat, Thursday (23/2/2023). Apart from that, he said, PT Bintan Alumina Indonesia (BAI) as the manager, will also build a Steam Power Plant (PLTU) of around 1,200 Megawatts, to support productivity in the area.\nNot only that, PT BAI has  also taken care of expanding the Galang Batang SEZ to Poto Island, Bintan Coastal District at the Ministry of Agrarian Planning and Spatial Planning of the National Land Agency (ART/BPN).\n\"\"About 2,180 hectares (Ha) have issued land permits from the Ministry of Art/BPN,\"\" he explained.\nPart of the land, continued Indra, will be built for an ammunition factory to support domestic defense needs.\n\"\"They have collaborated with PT Amerald Global as the investor in the weapons ammunitions factor.

Along with easing the pandemic, we hope this government-private synergy will be able to revive the community's economy.\"\"\n\"\"This MoU between PLN and PT BAI is to prepare electrical energy for the aluminium mining industry. PLN is committed to providing sufficient power to develop the industrial sector. The hope is that it can spur national economic growth, \"\"Adi said.\nAdi explained that according to the agreement, PLN will provide 1,300 megawatts (MW) of electricity for PT BAI until 2050. However, the supply will be carried out in stages, namely 300 MW in 2026, 500 MW in 2027, and 1,300 MW in 2029-2050.\nIn this provision, PLN will prioritize the power supply from new renewable energy (EBT) based plants with massive potential in Sumatra.\nAdi added, \"\"Currently, PLN's electricity supply for the Sumatra region is already qualified with a power surplus of 1,710 MW. As the capacity of NRE power plants increases in 2026, there will be enough power available that the mining community in Sumatra can absorb.\"\"\nPT BAI's President Director, Santoni, welcomed the signing of this MoU because it will support the aluminium utilization industry in the Galang Batang SEZ. Especially for PT BAI, that will be building an aluminium smelter with a production capacity of 250,000 tonnes of aluminium annually.\n\"\"This cooperation will be mutually beneficial. The aluminium industry and its derivatives require a large amount of electrical energy. Especially for the Galang Batang SEZ, we will need 2,850 MW in the near future,” said Santoni.\nSantoni continued that PT BAI will follow government regulations to use EBT-based electricity in supplying electrical energy. So, according to him, the MoU with PLN is an alternative for the provision of EBT for PT BAI.\n\"\"Hopefully, through this MoU, PLN can provide reliable and economical electricity supply. Hopefully, the realization of this collaboration can build a productive smelter for the downstream industry of aluminium derivatives and various other industries that will be present in the Galang Batang SEZ,\"\" explained Santoni.\nAgung Murdifi, the PLN Main Unit General Manager for Riau and Riau Islands, said, \"\"This momentum was an opportunity for both parties to increase the supply and use of EBT in the industrial sector. Until July 2022, PLN's EBT mix for the Sumatra region is 27.94 per cent or equivalent to 2,427 MW, with the majority using water energy (PLTA).\"\"\n\"\"This memorandum of understanding proves that PT BAI is very committed to supplying industrial electricity from NRE. This follows the government's decision to achieve 23 per cent of the NRE mix by 2025. This commitment to clean energy is certainly our collective obligation,\"\" concluded Agung.\"\n\n(Pemerintah Provinsi Kepulauan Riau, 1/24/2022, kepriprov.go.id): \"The details of the investment development stages so far are the existence of an alumina  refinery, a PLTU with a capacity of 6x25 MW, a gas station  as a downstream coal for roasting alumina, and a dormitory for worker accommodation. \nFor the second phase, the project is planned to be completed by the end of 2024. During this phase, an additional  alumina refinery  with a capacity of 1 million tons, a phase 1 aluminum smelter with a capacity of 250,000 tons, and a PLTU with a capacity of 6x150 MW will be built. \nIn the next stage until 2027, there will be an increase in smelter capacity from 250,000 to one million tons per year, an additional PLTU with a capacity of 4x150 MW for additional production of 250,000 tons of ingots, and a PLTU with a capacity of 8x150 MW to supply electricity for production of 500,000 tons of ingots.\"",

However, the Project Development Kick Off Ceremony was carried out by the Board of Directors together with the Board of Commissioners of Pupuk Kaltim, Tuesday, 10 January 2023.\n\"As far as I can see, there is no mention of PT. Pupuk Kalimantan Timur as the PSN of the Fertilizer Industrial Area in Fakfak Regency, West Papua in the Presidential Decree, including in its several amendments. We are worried that this will become a serious problem considering the socio-political experience of the people in West Papua in general, who often intersect with the government, especially when it relates to indigenous peoples' land use,\" said Filep, Monday (16/1/2023)....\nIn this regard, the Deputy Chairman of Committee I DPD RI reminded about the experience of the 7 ethnic communities in Teluk Bintuni Regency regarding BP Tangguh. According to him, the settlement of compensation payments must go through a long procedure, debates, demonstrations, and other matters to obtain rights for indigenous peoples.\n\"Within that scope, strengthening the position of indigenous peoples in the new Papua Special Autonomy Law must also be considered. Its existence must continue to be recognized, maintained, maintained, and developed. That is why 10 percent of the Oil and Gas Revenue Sharing Fund (DBH) is allocated for empowering indigenous peoples,\" said Filep.\nFurthermore, Filep said, with regard to land use for PSN, Government Regulation Number 42 of 2021 concerning Facilitation of National Strategic Projects requires the Minister to coordinate the formulation of policy strategies and approval for handling social impacts submitted by ministers/heads of institutions, governors and regents. /mayor. This means that the government is required to have a policy to deal with social impacts, for example the rejection of indigenous peoples, refusal of compensation, including the environmental impacts caused.\n“The question is, has the regional government proposed the form or type of social impact to be analyzed by the central government? Traumatic experiences of indigenous peoples in West Papua related to development have often been experienced. Don't let this backfire on the government because the PP emphasizes that the minister facilitates problem solving in business licensing and land acquisition for National Strategic Projects,\" he said.\n\"In this PP, Ministers, governors and/or regents/mayors must prepare programs and budgets for handling social impacts for directly affected communities, namely people who control state land or land owned by the Central Government, Regional Governments, BUMN, or regionally owned enterprises, communities with land rights, or communities experiencing direct and measurable losses. Thus, social impacts, for example land acquisition for PSN in West Papua, must be resolved in an integrated, effective and efficient manner, without leaving prolonged conflicts,\" Filep added.\nOn the same occasion, Senator Filep also highlighted the dissemination which he considered not sufficiently heard regarding the location of the Pupuk Kaltim project. He considered that the steps for hearing opinions, gathering aspirations, involving affected communities were not heard at all.

On PSN liar as \"Kawasan Industri Pulau Obi.\"\n\n(Kompas, 4/10/2023, lestari.kompas.com): Already has PSN status, what is the progress of the Obi Island nickel industrial area?\n\"SOUTH HALMAHERA, KOMPAS.com -  The Obi Island Industrial Area, in South Halmahera Regency, North Maluku Province, has changed its status from provincial to National Scale Development, since 2020. This follows the publication of Presidential Regulation (Pepres) of the Republic of Indonesia Number 109 of 2020, concerning the Third Amendment to Presidential Decree Number 3 of 2016 concerning the Acceleration of Implementation of National Strategic Projects. Then  the Regulation of the Coordinating Minister (Permen) for Economic Affairs Number 21 of 2022 concerning the Second Amendment to the Coordinating Minister for Economic Affairs Regulation Number 7 of 2021 concerning Changes to the PSN List. With this change in status, all kinds of supporting infrastructure for the Obi Island Industrial Area will be handled by the Ministry of Public Works and Public Housing (PUPR).\nHow is the progress currently? The industrial area built by PT Trimegah Bangun Persada (TPB) or Harita Nickel through the entity PT Dharma Cipta Mulia (DCM) is projected to require investment funds worth IDR 31.32 trillion. Director of Health, Safety and Environmental Operations Department of Harita Nickel Group, Tonny Gultom, said that the Obi Island Industrial Area was designed as a  green industrial park . \"It occupies 15,000 hectares of land and will be worked on in a former mining area,\" said Tonny on Obi Island, Saturday (8/9/2023). Currently, the Company is preparing a feasibility study , parallel to the master plan .\nTony revealed that the two stages of preparation are targeted to be approved, and then move on to the next step, namely an environmental impact analysis (AMDAL) in 2023. \"If  the master plan  is successful,  the feasibility study  is approved, the AMDAL is safe this year, then offers to investors will begin immediately,\" continued Tonny. On Obi Island itself, currently  tenants or affiliated companies are operating, namely PT Gane Permai Sentosa, PT Halmahera Jaya Feronikel and PT Megah Surya Pertiwi (MSP), including another partner company, PT Halmahera Persada Lygend (HPAL).\nMSP operates a smelter with a production capacity of 240,000 tons of ferronickel (FeNi) per year from four production lines. With nickel saprolite as raw material, nickel ore is processed through a pyrometallurgical system using Rotary Kiln-Electric Furnace (RKEF) technology. Ferronickel has a nickel content of 10-12 percent and is a semi-finished processed product which is further processed into the final product as raw material for the stainless steel industry, electronics, coins, transportation and household goods. Meanwhile, HPAL is an entity whose 45.1 percent shares are owned by TBP. This pioneer industry produces mixed hydroxide precipitate (MHP) and end products nickel sulfate and cobalt sulfate. Nickel sulfate (NiSO4) is useful as a precursor material for lithium batteries or electric vehicle batteries, while cobalt sulfate (CoSO4) is used as a cathode material for lithium batteries.\nWith the operation of MSP and HPAL, DCM decided to carry out future development as a form of mining transformation towards downstreaming. \"Because we have large reserves.  We are currently exploring two more IUPs which we will develop. The industrial area we will build is an industrial area based on nickel mining. The derivative of nickel is what we call transformation,\" explained Tonny. Therefore, he continued, the Obi Island Industrial Area will be designed with the concept of a nickel mining-based industrial area. The company opens  opportunities for investors to develop its downstream direction, including stainless steel products, electric car components, to nickel sulfate and cobalt sulfate. In the infrastructure sector, the Company ensures that it will expand ports, build airports and road infrastructure as well as a Solar Power Plant (PTSL) with a capacity of 300 MegaWatt and raw water. Tonny confirmed that the company's commitment is to carry out the government's mandate by optimizing the added value of nickel resources and providing optimal benefits. \"We realize this commitment through operations that are responsible for the environment, society and good governance,\" he said.\"\n\n(Hidranto, 6/30/2021, indonesia.go.id): \"Coordinating Minister for Maritime Affairs and Investment Luhut Binsar Pandjaitan when inaugurating the production operation of a nickel smelter using high pressure acid bleaching technology (HPAL) on Obi Island, South Halmahera, North Maluku, Wednesday ( 23/6/2021 ), suggested that the island would become a new center of growth. \"It is hoped that this area will become a center for regional development and growth in Obi Island, in particular, and in Halmahera, as well as North Maluku in general,\" he hoped...On that occasion, the Coordinating Minister Luhut was present with the Minister of Home Affairs, Minister of Transportation, Minister of Investment/BKPM, Governor of North Maluku, Regent of South Halmahera, Kakorpolairud 2 Marv, Deputy for Investment and Mining Coordination, Director General of Mineral and Coal of the Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources, and Director General of Hubud Ministry of Transportation.\nAt this inauguration, the Coordinating Minister for Luhut signed the inscription on the factory operations and initial shipment of PT Halmahera Persada Lygend's Mixed Hydroxide Precipitate (MHP) on Obi Island, North Maluku. The HPAL smelter has an MHP production capacity of 365 thousand tonnes per year and is the basic raw material for electric vehicle batteries. The product is in the form of MHP, which is a mixture of hydroxide solids from nickel and cobalt...\n\"Halmahera Persada Lygend is a low grade nickel ore (limonite) processing and refining facility with hydrometallurgical technology known as HPAL. HPAL construction began in August 2018 and is ready for commercial production. This is the first HPAL plant in Indonesia,\" explained Stevi Thomas as Commissioner Utama Halmahera Persada Lygend, as quoted from the company's official statement, Thursday (24/6/2021).\nDuring the inauguration ceremony, Coordinating Minister Luhut said that the operation of the HPAL smelter showed that Indonesia was capable of driving the downstream mineral industry and could support the national electric vehicle industry in the future. \"We are very proud because we have all witnessed the history of the establishment of HPAL in Indonesia. Indonesia can prove itself capable,\" he explained.\"",

With the execution of the first metal tapping process, Antam will commence preparations for commercial production.”\nThe initial stages of the Haltim Feronickel Plant’s operation began on July 7, 2023, marked by the “burner-on” process, which involves heating the furnace before applying electrical current.\nFollowing the completion of the furnace process, the Haltim Feronickel Plant proceeded with the “switch on furnace” phase, officially launching the nickel smelting plant in conjunction with chromium metal.\nIn 2020, Antam continued its progress in completing Phase I Line I of the Haltim Feronickel Plant. In addition, Antam also completed the supporting infrastructure for the plant, which had been under construction since 2017.\nBy December 2020, physical construction progress of the plant had reached an impressive 98.12% completion. Alongside the feronickel processing plant, Antam continued developing supporting infrastructure in 2020, including the expansion of the town site area and other infrastructure in line with established targets and plans.\nLocated in Halmahera Timur, North Maluku, the Haltim Feronickel Plant is set to have a production capacity of 13,500 Metric Tons of Nickel in Feronickel (TNi).\nUpon full operation, it will complement the feronickel production from the Kolaka Feronickel Plant in Southeast Sulawesi, which boasts a capacity of 27,000 TNi. This will bring Antam’s installed portfolio of feronickel production capacity to an impressive 40,500 TNi.\nMoreover, the Haltim Feronickel Plant will be equipped with various key production facilities, including a 170-ton-per-hour Rotary Dryer, a 165-ton-per-hour Rotary Kiln, a 60 MW Electric Smelting Furnace, and other supporting production facilities.\"\n\n(Halmaheranesia, 9/7/2023, halmaheranesia.com): The threat to the Wato-Wato Springs, Halmahera, from the mining industry\n\"Residents of Buli, East Halmahera, North Maluku, are voicing the fate of the Wato-Wato mountains and forests which are currently becoming a mining industrial area or area.\nThrough a press release received by halmaheranesia , Said Marsaoly, a resident of Buli, said that mining activities in East Halmahera had had a negative impact on destroying residents' living spaces, from the mainland to coastal areas and small islands in the vicinity.\n\"In this area which was previously rich in nutmeg and cloves, there are 27 mining business permits (IUP), with a total concession area of ​​172,901.95 hectares,\" said Said, Wednesday, September 6 2023.\nSaid said, of the total mining permits, PT Aneka Tambang (ANTAM) is one of the largest concession holding companies that controls the mainland area of ​​Halmahera, down to the small islands of Gee and Pakal.\nAccording to him, apart from PT Antam's operations, now Mount Wato-Wato, which is important for residents, is also being targeted by PT Priven Lestari. On Mount Wato-Wato there are protected forest areas and village forests which function as water catchment areas.\n\"From the Wato-Wato forest area, there are springs that flow through three large rivers and several tributaries which have been the main source of water for thousands of residents, and have even become a source of raw water for PDAM Buli,\" he said.\nApart from that, at the foot of Mount Wato-Wato there are also residents' agricultural land planted with nutmeg, cloves and pineapples. All of this is the main source of the people's economy.\nNow, he said, the government and PT Priven Lestari's efforts to open a mining industry on Mount Wato-Wato have the potential to wipe out the entire source of life for these residents.\n\"This coercive effort can be seen from the public discussion or consultation process on AMDAL documents from 2015 to 2018 which did not accommodate residents' voices of objection,\" he explained.\nHe explained that the series of acts of resistance by residents so far has actually been responded to with attempts to criminalize residents who refuse mining.\n\"This criminalization effort can be seen from the appearance of summons from the police against eleven residents who refused mining in July 2023, on charges of abuse, threats and vandalism,\" he said.\nIn fact, what the residents are doing is simply defending their last living space, namely Mount Wato-Wato, from the mining industry.He said that based on this situation, the residents of East Halmahera, who had gathered in the Buli Caring Wato-Wato Community Alliance, pressed for several demands.\n“Urge the Minister of Energy and Mineral Resources to immediately stop and revoke PT Priven Lestari's mining permit. \"Urge the Minister of Environment and Forestry not to process the application for a Borrow-to-Use Forest Area Permit (IPPKH) for PT Priven Lestari, and to impose strict legal sanctions for its operations that damage forest areas,\" he explained.\nThen, they also urged the police to stop the legal process against the residents who reported it, and asked the Regent and DPRD of Haltim, the Governor and DPRD of North Maluku to immediately issue a recommendation to stop operations and revoke PT Priven Lestari's permit to the Minister of Energy and Mineral Resources.\n\"Urge Komnas HAM to conduct an investigation into alleged human rights violations committed by PT Priven Lestari, the government and the police,\" concluded Said.\nUntil this news was broadcast, PT Priven Lestari and other parties were trying to confirm the pressure from Buli residents.\"\n\n(ANTAM, 1/3/2023, antam.com): \"PT Aneka Tambang Tbk (ANTAM; IDX: ANTM; ASX: ATM) member of Mining Industry Indonesia (MIND ID) - the State-Owned Enterprise Holding of the Mining Industry Indonesia, focused on implementation of downstream-based initiative strategic development to increase the added value of mining product and strengthen the Company's core business, including the completion of Haltim Ferronickel Plant Development Project with its supporting infrastructure, entering construction project phase.\nAs a follow-up activity in the implementation of the Power Purchase Agreement (PJBTL) of the electricity supply for the East Halmahera Ferronickel Plant between ANTAM and PT Perusahaan Listrik Negara (Persero) (PT PLN) was signed on March. Currently, the electricity procurement phase in the form of PT PLN's Diesel and Gas Power Plant (PLTDG) is being carried out. The first phase of the 15 megawatts (MW) power plant was switched-on in December 2022. Furthermore, the second phase power plant switch-on of the total 75 MW is planned to be carried out in the first quarter of 2023 which will be followed by a series of commissioning phases of the power plant and ferronickel plant.   \nANTAM’s Director of Business Development, Dolok Robert Silaban said:\n“Through a positive synergy and strong commitment between ANTAM and PT PLN, the implementation of PJBTL can be optimally performed in order to accelerate the completion of construction phase of Haltim Ferronickel Plant.

Merdeka will release 11 billion shares to the public, representing 10.24% of the company at an offer price of between 780 rupiah and 795 rupiah per share.\nThe company said it is planning to release an additional 1.1 billion shares in case of oversubscription, meaning it could potentially raise up to 9.62 trillion rupiah, which could make the IPO the second biggest at the Indonesia Stock Exchange so far this year. The IDX debut is slated for April 18.\n\"We're currently in an early stage to expand to the downstream industry along the EV battery value chain,\" Merdeka Battery President Devin Ridwan said in a written statement on Thursday. \"Through this IPO, [Merdeka Battery] will ensure that our corporate strategic plans will progress maximally.\"\nIndonesia is the world's biggest nickel producer and holds the largest proven reserves of the metal, a key component in long-range electric vehicle batteries. Companies like Merdeka and other nickel miners hope to ride on the government's push to utilize the country's reserves to develop a battery industry, enter the global EV supply chain and develop a manufacturing base. With a population of more than 270 million, Indonesia also offers a potentially huge market for EVs.\nMerdeka Battery earlier this month unveiled a plan to develop its first high-pressure acid leach (HPAL) plant at the Indonesia Konawe Industrial Park, a nickel industrial complex on the southeastern part of Sulawesi island, Indonesia's nickel heartland. The HPAL technology is used to refine Indonesia's low-grade nickel ore into battery-grade materials. The planned facility will have a total capacity of 120,000 tons of nickel equivalent per year.\nMerdeka Battery on March 16 signed a memorandum of understanding with Ningbo Brunp Contemporary Amperex, an affiliate of CATL, for the first tranche of the project that will have half of the total planned capacity. The construction is expected to begin this year and the commissioning two years later.\nRidwan told a media briefing on Thursday that the development of the first tranche is estimated to cost $1.28 billion. He added part of the IPO proceeds will be used to finance the project, and some will come from Merdeka Battery's cash flow.\nA bigger portion of the IPO proceeds will be used to pay off debts, which Ridwan said will \"strengthen the company's fundamentals and give [us] a flexibility to look for new funding and expand.\"\nMerdeka Battery is separately partnering with Chinese stainless steel giant Tsingshan Holding to develop the 3,500-hectare Konawe park, for mining operations through joint venture Sulawesi Cahaya Mineral -- said to have one of the world's largest nickel resources -- and for operations of two smelters producing nickel pig irons.

In Routa District, Regent Kery facilitated the entry of PT.Sulawesi Cahaya Mineral (SCM) through the flag of PT.Indonesia Konawe Industrial Park (IKIP) which invested around IDR 58 trillion in capital. Mining activities in Routa are currently underway. PT.IKIP will explore over the mining business permit area (IUP) owned by PT.SCM, which is an area of ​​3,563 hectares. The corporation is currently building an industrial complex with various other supporting infrastructure. \nThe presence of investment in Routa is projected to absorb around six to eight thousand workers. It is believed that the absorption of so many workers will alleviate unemployment. Routa, which was previously branded as a marginal area, is now predicted to become a developed area thanks to the influx of investment in the region. \nKonawe Regent Kery Saiful Konggoasa said, through private investment in Routa, nickel factories and other derivatives will be built in that area. This includes nickel derivatives, namely lithium, which is used as a raw material for making electric vehicle batteries. \"We are grateful for the investment in Routa. We need the investment in order to accelerate regional progress. This investment will also help us overcome employment problems in Konawe,\" Regent Kery told Kendari Pos yesterday. \nMeanwhile, Konawe Secretary (Sekab) Konawe Ferdinand Sapan stated, PT.SCM has so far continued to improve the progress of the development of industrial estates in Routa. Including, the acceleration of the production process this year from the initial target in 2024. Ferdinand said, the Konawe Regency Government had also provided support as a form of support for accelerating the development of industrial estates in Routa by PT. SCM. \n\"The government's support, one of which is that we accelerate the Routa Detailed Spatial Plan (RDTR). Thus, when corporations build their industrial estates or other supporting areas related to industry, it will have a positive impact on the community. That's why, we have to prepare the RDTR from the start ,\" he explained. \nWith that support, said Ferdinand Sapan, PT.SCM will consistently prioritize all the potential that exists in Konawe to support the company's production activities. Whether it's the potential of natural resources (SDA) or human resources (HR). \nThe former Head of BPKAD Konawe admitted that on various occasions when he met delegations from PT. SCM, he always asked the corporation to prioritize local potential rather than looking elsewhere. \"One of the things I conveyed to the company, if they need to eat there and still eat from rice, never buy rice from other places. They have to buy rice from Konawe. Later, if Konawe can't afford it, then look elsewhere,\" said Ferdinand Sapa. He said, to further strengthen the commitment between the government and the private sector regarding investment in Routa, the Konawe Regency Government will also make a memorandum of understanding with PT.SCM. For example, the Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) related to the concept of managing Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) funds which is the responsibility of the company. \n\"So we use methods like that. The MoU includes the education sector. Later we will try to convey that our human resources need to be pushed or increased in level. So that the company must take a role in it,\" explained Ferdy, the nickname of the Regency Secretary. Konawe it. \nFerdy continued, industrial activity in Routa by PT. SCM, would certainly open up new jobs in the local authorities. Many Konawe local workers (TKL) can be recruited by the company. Ferdinand Sapan said, the latest report from PT. SCM, 2,500 workers had been recruited to build the mega industrial complex in the westernmost region of Konawe. But the problem going forward, he continued, is when corporations need skilled workers (skills). Meanwhile, the readiness of Konawe's human resources with special skills is still relatively low. \"One of the things we have prepared is the later integration of the need for skilled workers from the Polytechnic in Morosi. And also, later we will build other vocations. We will also try to communicate with other universities. Both in Konawe as well as in the provincial capital,\" concluded Ferdy. (*)\"",

Various efforts will be made to achieve the investment realization target, including providing convenience in permitting investors to invest in NTB. Apart from that, we also provide guidance, supervision, and acceleration of realization for investors, especially national strategic projects, one example of which is the smelter,\" explained Rum.\nRegarding the contribution of the AMMAN smelter, President Director Rachmat Makkasau said that this achievement illustrates the company's commitment to supporting economic growth.\n\"This achievement is the result of a joint collaboration where we see enormous support for the construction of smelters, both from the central and regional governments. We really hope that support from the government will continue to be given to us so that the smelter project can continue to run in parallel with our operational business activities, so that other big projects that will increase investment value can be realized. Apart from supporting the NTB Province to achieve its 2023 investment target, this is also in line with the statement from the Coordinating Ministry for the Economy, Mr. Airlangga Hartarto, last Monday, which will continue to encourage the realization of the National Strategic Project (PSN) by resolving obstacles related to licensing for investment,\" said Rahmat.\nLooking at the results of last semester's verification, AMIN's smelter has reached 47 percent. This achievement is based on the calculation of the realization of the budget requirements for the smelter, which includes physical construction and also the purchase of equipment and machinery for operations.\nThe investment value that has been spent is equivalent to US$ 466 million out of a total of US$ 982 million. This shows the company's commitment to continuing the construction of the smelter. However, the constraints of the COVID-19 pandemic and the energy crisis in Europe, which are external factors, have caused logistical and human resource (HR) mobilization constraints, so that the target of completing the smelter in 2023 will not be realized.\nThe AMMAN smelter is targeted for completion in 2024. Some time ago, AMMAN also held a meeting with the NTB Government to explain the company's operational achievements and business plan in 2023.\nOn this occasion, the President Director of AMMAN said that the absorption of human resources (HR) for various projects since 2021 had increased to 35%, of which nearly 75% came from NTB.\nAMMAN is the second largest group of copper and gold mining and processing companies in Indonesia.

In addition, the smelter will produce 17.8 tons of gold, 54.7 tons of silver and 830.000 sulfate acid.\nAMMAN's Head of Social Impact Priyo Pramono added that the six-month verification achievement always exceeded the target and the construction of the camp was completed in October 2022.\n\"The smelter construction and supporting facilities have also started since July 2022 with the installation of stake poles, including the installation of special water facilities, in the form of desalized water and dem generalization. The mobilization of contractors to the construction area has also been carried out,\" he said.\nPriyo added that the purchase order for the long lead equipment has been executed. Moreover, there has been a signing of an agreement to finance syndicates from banks and companies that have processed recruitment in stages according to the construction stage, in collaboration with the West Sumbawa Regency Government (KSB) and NTB.\"\n\n(PT. Suara NTB Press, 8/11/2022, suarantb.com): KSB \"All Out\" Helps Realize Smelter Development\n\"The Regional Government of West Sumbawa Regency (KSB) is making every effort to help create a smelter or metal mineral smelting industry which is currently in the process of preparing for development. Moreover, in accordance with President Jokowi's directives, that all regional leaders must support the acceleration of investment in their respective regions.\nKSB Regent Dr. HW Musyafirin said that the smelter in this area will later trigger a derivative industry that can move the economy even faster. So that in this preparation process, the KSB Regional Government together with the NTB Provincial Government and PT. Amman Mineral Nusa Tenggara (AMNT) actively communicates with the central government so that all processes run smoothly.\nHe said the location for the smelter construction was in Otak Keris Hamlet, Maluk District, KSB. Maluk District itself has been designated by the central government as a priority industrial area along with 26 other priority industrial areas in Indonesia.\n\"The Maluk District has been decided to become an industrial area out of 27 priority industrial areas to be built in Indonesia and it is included in the national medium-term development plan for 2020-2024,\" said HW Musyafirin in a special interview with Suara NTB recently.\nIn order to create an industrial area, including for the construction of a smelter, the Regional Government of KSB has the principle that there should be no obstacles, especially those that come from the government. The government must go all out to provide support.\n''So from the start we were with the Regional Leadership Communication Forum, where there were the Chair of the PN, the Chair of the DPRD, the Kajari, the Head of the Police and the Dandim all out to help,'' said the Regent.\nHe said, PT. AMNT has written a letter to KSB containing a request for facilitation of land acquisition in Otak Keris Hamlet, which incidentally is a village area. Initially the Regional Government of KSB hoped that the Smelter could be built in the coastal area, especially where PT. AMNT already owns around 200 hectares of land.\n''However, technically the location did not meet the requirements, so during the trip the Otak Keris area was chosen, even though this is a village area,'' he said.\nOtak Keris is included in the plan to establish an industrial area with an area of ​​1,164 hectares. Because it will be used as an industrial zone, land in hamlets with around 60 families is included in the land acquisition priority.\n''What was needed at that time was 150 hectares, plus another 20 hectares. So more or less what we have freed is around 170 hectares, and it's all clear . Until the last, around 61 hectares, the settlement was through the courts. It's already inrah, the decision from the Supreme Court has also been passed,''explained the Regent.\nMusyafirin admitted that he is very optimistic that this smelter will definitely be realized, especially since his party has moved very far to realize this project. It's just that the Covid-19 pandemic has hampered this program a bit, but in principle this smelter will still be built according to plan.\nCurrently, in preparation for the construction of a smelter, camps or workers' camps are being built with a total of around 2000 – 3000 camps. An engaged workforce with prioritizing local labour. Even now, the Integrated Team tasked with recruiting workers is currently selecting around 1,200 workers for smelter preparation.\n Regarding the proportion of local workers in the construction of this smelter, the Regional Government of KSB certainly prioritizes local workers and local resources for company needs. Likewise other resources such as building materials and food needs so that PT. AMNT absorbs the maximum from the local community.\n“In every meeting with AMNT, we always convey that local resources must be a priority. Local resources such as materials, sand, crushed stone, as well as local materials such as rice, vegetables and others. Including labor resources, it must be prioritized from KSB,\" he said.\nThe KSB Regent admitted that he had drafted a regional regulation so that it was the responsibility of the company, and all sub-contractors working in KSB to use local human resources of at least 40 percent. Prior to drafting this Perda, a Perbup first appeared which required companies to absorb local workers and other local resources with a minimum amount of 60 percent.\n“However, we will make a regional regulation for a minimum of 40 percent of resources. Moreover, the central government has asked that spending on local products be at least 40 percent in the regional budget. We try to comply with regulations,\" he explained.\nThe Regional Government of KSB has conducted a comparative study in Gresik, East Java to take a close look at the smelter industry there and its derivative industries. The Department of Manpower has been given orders to train local workers to become skilled by inviting the involvement of PT. AMNT.

In addition, in the Spatial Pattern Plan, both the Revised RTRW for the Province of NTB and the Regional Regulation on the RTRW for West Sumbawa Regency, it is stated that the area of ​​the West Sumbawa Regency Industrial Area is 1,160 Ha, which is divided into several zones, as follows:\nThe smelter zone and its derivative industries cover an area of ​​850 Ha which has received recommendations for suitability for spatial use from the NTB Provincial Spatial Planning Coordination Team (TKPRD) in 2018. From an area of ​​850 Ha it is divided into smelter zones covering 154 Ha (100% land acquisition has been carried out by PT . AMNT) and smelter-derived industrial zones covering an area of ​​696 Ha (not entirely cleared);\nSmall and medium industrial zone (IKM) covering an area of ​​310 Ha.\nIn this case, the NTB Province BAPPEDA has always been cooperative and is willing to provide the data needed by the BPKP regarding the smelter construction plan. The Team for the Acceleration of Smelter Development and Its Derivative Industries, which consists of relevant stakeholders , both from the NTB Provincial Government and the West Sumbawa Regency Government, which has worked based on the NTB Governor's Decree since 2018, has carried out its duties to the fullest at the planning stage. For the implementation phase, there has been a change in the schedule for the completion of the smelter construction, which was originally planned to be completed in 2022, to be postponed to 2023. PT. AMNT explained that this was due to the Covid 19 pandemic, so that the progress of the smelter construction has not yet been significant. Regarding the decrease in production capacity of 1.3 MTPA (million tonnes per annual / million tonnes per year) to 0.9 MTPA, the Head of the ESDM Service explained that this was the authority of the central government.\nClosing the event, the Secretary of West Nusa Tenggara Province said that the NTB Provincial Government and West Sumbawa Regency Government must continue to oversee and immediately take care of accelerating the clarity of the status of Industrial Estates in West Sumbawa Regency, West Nusa Tenggara Province and it is hoped that clarity on the status of this industrial area will be obtained before the construction of a smelter and its derivative industries held.\"\n\n(Lombok Post, 6/9/2021, lombokpost.jawapos.com): Congratulations, West Sumbawa Enters the 2020-2024 National RPJM Industrial Area\n\"TALIWANG-West Sumbawa Regency (KSB) is designated as an industrial area and is included in the 2020-2024 medium-term development plan (RPJMN).\n“The smelter is only a small part.

Rudi Wijaya, President Director of PT Millennium Power, said that PT PGN's willingness to supply gas for the PLTGU which will be built in the Millennium Industrial Estate area is a big capital for the company to accelerate the realization of the construction of this power plant . “This is a big event for us by getting gas support from PT PGN. \"Previously, PT PGN had supplied gas to tenants in the Millennium industrial area,\" he said in Jakarta, when signing the HoA, Wednesday (1/4/2015). Jobi Triananda Hasjim, Director of Business at PT PGN Tbk., said that the construction of a 1,000 MW PLTGU is a big project that is really needed by industry, especially in delivering electricity in the West Java region.\nIn the future, he continued, not only PT Millennium Power will be supported in supplying gas for PLTGU, but other parties such as PT Perusahaan Perusahaan Perusahaan Negara (PLN) which is actively replacing fuel oil-based power plants will also be fully supported by PGN. He said, with the volume of gas requested by PT Millennium Power up to 2024 being quite large, it is hoped that this collaboration can soon be upgraded to an agreement so that PGN can immediately search for and increase its gas supply. According to him, even though Indonesia's macroeconomy is currently unstable, in line with increasingly rapid industrial growth, electricity supply capacity to this sector must continue to be increased. Lebinner Sinaga, Tangerang Area Manager of PT PGN Tbk., said that the construction of the PLTGU will be carried out in four stages until 2024. The first stage of construction is targeted for completion in the first quarter of 2017 with a total volume of gas used of 40 million cubic meters.\n\"The total gas that will be supplied by PGN until the final stage of development reaches 240 million cubic meters,\" he said to Bisnis.

This CCPP has two units of Gas Turbine Generator (GTG), two units of Heat Recovery Steam Generator (HRSG) and one unit of Steam Turbine Generator (STG)...\nPower Network Distribution System\nPT KDL's transmission and distribution network is in the form of an underground electricity network. In terms of reliability, compared with overhead network, underground electricity network will be easier and safer to operate than overhead network. About 95 percent of PT KDL's distribution network uses ring system cable channels.\nThe distribution mechanism of PT KDL's electricity starts from the generation of electrical energy in each generator of 10.5 kilovolts (kV). In order to be properly channeled, the voltage is then increased to 150 kV to the divider rail (busbar). From each of these busbar voltages that have been adjusted are channeled to each customer of PT KDL ranging from 30 kV, 20 kV, 6 kV to 400 Volts.\nPT KDL guarantees the quality of electrical energy produced according to industry standards. For this reason, PT KDL built a compensator system to maintain voltage stability. PT Krakatau Steel (Persero) Tbk. as the main consumer, gets the installation of compensator systems in each of its factory.\nInterconnection with PLN\nInitially PT KDL plant designed to operate independently (isolated system). But over time, the growth of many new factories in the Krakatau Industrial Estate also create new demand to PT KDL. To anticipate this, PT KDL’s CCPP interconnected with PLN. PT KDL's transmission network is interconnected with PLN's 150 kV network through High Voltage Air Conducting (HUTT).\nRecently, the electricity supply contract from PLN is 200 MVA. Since August 2003, this supply contract expanded with an agreement to synergize electricity delivery between PLN, PT KS, and PT KDL. This is to compensate the condition of the electricity crisis during the Peak Load Time (WBP). During an emergency, this interconnection network will work hand in hand in the power plant start-up process.\"\n\n(Indonesia Industrial Estates Directory 2018-2019, 2019, business-indonesia.org): \"Electricity: PT PLN (Persero), PT Krakatau Daya Listrik\nCapacity: 3,400 MVA\"", "Electricity Capacity (MW)": 320.0, "GEM": null, "Latitude": -6.000831, "Longitude": 106.043214, "Sources": "https://dinsights.katadata.co.id/read/2023/06/14/krakatau-industrial-estate-sold-94-of-its-landbank\nhttps://ekonomi.bisnis.com/read/20190102/47/874696/kiec-kembangkan-kawasan-industri-iii-420-hektare\nhttps://en.antaranews.com/news/256333/ksp-invites-south-korean-companies-to-invest-in-cilegon-estate\nhttps://www.antaranews.com/berita/3585459/kawasan-industri-yang-dikelola-pt-ksp-tersisa-40-hektare\n(Archived link, 11/27/23) https://web.archive.org/web/20231127172956/https://kemenperin.go.id/kawasan\nhttps://kiec.co.id/id/\nhttps://kiec.co.id/en/industrial-area-3/\nhttps://www.energytransitionpartnership.org/uploads/2022/09/The-Electricity-Infrastructure-Planning-and-Investment-Needs-to-Support-Energy-Transition.pdf \nhttps://business-indonesia.org/files/estates/XqRIF7ytNNH618MbKBFjEY7Va1y02Ov9Tf968LY7.pdf\nhttps://kce.co.id/product/energy" }, "geometry": { "type": "Point", "coordinates": [ 106.043214, -6.000831 ] } },

PT Growth Asia is a company under the management of the Growth Steel Group (GSG) with an integrated steel industry core business.\nThis 2 x 15 MW Biomass PLTU was built in 2011 and uses fuel from renewable energy, namely palm shells, rice husks, corn cobs and wood dust ( Waste to Energy ).\nThe construction of the Biomass PLTU is basically intended to meet its own needs. However, the power produced exceeds requirements, so there is excess power of 20 MW. The excess electrical power is sold to PT. PLN (Persero) North Sumatra Region.\nPreviously, PT. Growth Sumatra Industry, also one of the companies under the management of the Growth Steel Group, has built 1 x 15 MW in 2008 and 1 x 15 MW in 2010.

ELECTRICAL SYSTEM INTEGRATION\nElectrical System Integration (ESI) is a unit that functions to distribute electrical power from several factory generators in the PT Pupuk Kalimantan Timur Industrial Area. Electrical power from each generator can be used for the needs of each factory. With the ESI Unit, electrical power from one factory can be used for other factories via the Main Ring Unit.\nThe ESI unit was built by KDM in 2007 and is very useful for continuing production in factories in the PT Pupuk Kalimantan Timur Industrial Area. This is because if the electricity generator of one of the factories connected to the ESI Unit experiences a problem and results in it tripping or shutting down, then the electricity consumption at that factory can be supplied from another factory's generator. The electrical network supplied uses a voltage of 33 kV and is maintained at a frequency of 50 Hz for equipment stability\"\n\n(PT Kaltim Daya Mandiri LinkedIn, n.d., linkedin.com): About\n\"PT Kaltim Daya Mandiri is a subsidiary of PT Pupuk Indonesia Energi.

The facility will be equipped with a 20 MWh (megaWatt hours) battery energy storage system. \n“SESNA has been selected as the project initiator and will own, build, test, finance and operate the solar project farm,” the company’s Marketing Manager Atikah Amaliadanti told Indonesia Business Post on June 2, 2022.\nShe did not reveal the amount invested in the project. She said, however, that the company would be open to collaborating with potential partners in the development of this project, including obtaining financing from abroad.\n“We are open to various collaboration schemes not only for this project but for future projects as well,” Amaliadanti.\nNickel Mines plans to utilize renewable energy by producing electricity to nickel processing sites in its operational areas.\nThe project will be supported by technology and equipment imported from suppliers and vendors in Europe and China. The majority of suppliers are top-tier manufacturers. The company is open to opportunities for technology and equipment suppliers from the United States, Europe, and China.\nThe project is currently in its development phase, which includes study, technical analysis and preparation of Detailed Engineering Design based on the survey. The timeline for the construction and operation will be based on the study results.\n“We are optimistic that this project will proceed smoothly,” Amaliadanti said, adding that procurement and construction schedules will be synchronized. Pre-construction preparations will be discussed so that construction can begin as soon as possible.\n“As part of the company’s commitment to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, we are pleased to maintain a good relationship with SESNA through the signing of this MoU for a 200 MWp solar power project,” said Nickel Mines Managing Director Justin Werner in January 2022.\nAccording to the agreement, Nickel Mines will be responsible for the cost based on their monthly power usage. “In addition to efficient operation costs, Nickel Mines will also benefit from guaranteed operations and maintenance,” Amaliadanti concluded.\nThe total planned capacity of the solar farm project is 396kWp (kiloWatt peak) plus 250kWh (kiloWatt hour) of battery storage at Hengjaya Nickel Mine which is 80% owned by Nickel Mines.

The state-owned stun company has signed an Electricity Sales and Purchase Letter (SJBTL) with the Dumai Industrial Area (KID) manager PT Wilmar Nabati Indonesia (Wina), in Jakarta, Wednesday (15/11/2017).  This SJBTL was signed by Irwansyah M. Putra as General Manager of PLN Riau and Riau Islands Region (WRKR) with Erik Tjia as Deputy Director of PT Wilmar Nabati Indonesia, witnessed by PLN Sumatra Regional Business Director Wiluyo Kusdwiharto.  Currently, KID requires around 35 megawatt hours (MWH) of electricity. So far, KID, which has its own steam power plant (PLTU), supplies coal from Kalimantan.  Deputy Director of PT Wilmar Nabati Erik Tjia said that the collaboration was to increase the electricity capacity of the industrial area on the west coast of Riau to develop its derivative industries.  He admitted that with this additional power, the Malaysian company saved 100 to 200 kwh or IDR 1.2 billion per year.  \"Coal prices are increasing. With this collaboration, we no longer need to think about electricity supply,\" he said to businesses on the sidelines of the cooperation signing event, Wednesday (15/11/2017).  Vienna is currently the largest PLN customer in Riau which will be a positive signal for the economic growth of Riau province. In the future, not only will the need for electricity increase, but PT WINA's production capacity will also increase and factories and industries derived from palm oil will be built in this area so that it can create new jobs. PLN Sumatra Regional Business Director Wiluyo said, in order to meet the demand for 60 MVA, PLN is building a 150 kV High Voltage Overhead Line (SUTT) 27 km long from the Dumai 150 kV Main Substation which is currently still under construction. Wiluyo is optimistic that this project can be completed in Semester I 2018. \"We will fulfill the first stage according to demand. However, if there is additional electricity, PLN is ready to distribute any amount of electricity,\" he said.  Riau has an installed electricity capacity of 620 MW with a reserve power of 200 MW. However, Riau still needs to build transmission and substations to deliver electricity to other industries and households.  The Riau Provincial Government continues to encourage the acceleration of transmission and substation construction. Syahrial Abdi, Head of the Riau Province Energy and Mineral Resources (ESDM) Service, said that the electricity infrastructure was built in several strategic locations to connect to industrial areas and areas that need electricity. \"The government continues to accelerate. Infrastructure development was hampered by land and other problems.

PLTU Suge also powers most of Belitung, but has had repeated issues with power outages. A palm oil power plant pilot took place at Kawasan Industri Suge in 2018. The regional government has also suggested the development of a solar power station at Kawasan Industri Suge.\n\n(Regional.Kontan.Co.Id, 5/18/2023): 100 Hectares of Land Prepared for PLTS Belitung\n\"100 hectares of land in the Suge industrial area, Pegantian Village, Belitung , Bangka Belitung Islands has been prepared as a location for a solar power plant (PLTS ). The regional government considers that PLTS is needed to maintain the reliability of electricity supply while supporting environmentally friendly tourism programs. \"We have conveyed it to the Ministry of Maritime Affairs and Fisheries to build PLTS energy,\" said Belitung Deputy Regent Isyak Meirobie to Kompas.com , Wednesday (17/5/2023).\nIsyak conveyed this regarding blackouts that often occur due to disruption of the Suge Steam Power Plant (PLTU). Previously there was a disturbance in the form of a furnace leak at the coal-fired generator. On Wednesday afternoon, disruption occurred again due to a lightning strike at a substation located in the PLTU area.\n\"It's no longer suitable for a leading destination like this, PLTU Suge can no longer afford it,\" said Isyak. Isyak hopes that the central government will immediately conduct a study for the construction of PLTS in Belitung, including estimates of costs and environmental impacts. The construction of PLTS is considered to be in line with the zero emissions or Net Zero Emissions (NZE) target which is targeted to be achieved by 2060. On the other hand, Isyak also expressed support if the government had alternative options to guarantee electricity supply in Belitung. One of them is related to the plan to build a Sumatran sea cable interconnection via Sadai, South Bangka. \"We hope that it will be realized soon,\" concluded Isyak.\"\n\nbelitung.tribunnews.com, 12/18/2018: Belitung Regent Inspects 5 MW Power Plant Fueled by Palm Oil\n\"REGENCY of Belitung H Sahani Saleh (Sanem) inspected the 5 MW power plant built by BUMD PT Belitung Mandiri in the Suge Industrial Area , Pegantin Village, Badau District, Belitung Regency, Monday (17/12).\nThis power plant, which uses crude palm oil (CPO) as fuel,  is prepared to support the supply of electrical energy in the Suge industrial area.\nAlso attending the review were Assistant for Economics and Development at the Regional Secretariat (Setda) of the Regional Government of Belitung Regency Jasagung Heriyadi, Head of the Belitung Regency Environmental Service (DLH) Ubaidillah, Head of the One Stop Integrated Investment and Industry Service of Belitung Regency Hilman.\nApart from that, there were also the Acting Head of the Belitung Regency Public Works and Public Housing (PUPR) Department, Agus Siregar, the Head of the Economic Section of the Belitung Regional Government Secretariat M Iqbal and the Director of PT Belitong Mandiri BUMD Azrul Anwar.\n\"This was already underway in January 2019. This is a pilot project for renewable energy, using CPO fuel,\" said Sanem during the inspection, Monday (17/12).\nSanem said, this CPO-fueled power plant will be inaugurated by the Minister of Energy and Mineral Resources (ESDM) Ignasius Jonan.\n\"We have already done the sounding with PLN, the only thing left now is the operation, everything is ready. The raw materials will be working with PT PUS for the CPO,\" said Sanem.\nSanem hopes that all people who have private oil palm plantations will sell their palm oil to PT PUS so that all fuel needs for this power plant can be met.\n\"Because there will be no term for palm oil to expire, all palm fruit goes into the factory process and is made into CPO. So the electricity will be purchased by PLN because PLN is the one who distributes it. It is also possible for companies in industrial areas to buy the electricity directly,\" he said. .\nSanem said this 5 MW power plant is environmentally friendly. \"We hope that factories in the Suge Industrial area will buy electrical power there. Even though PLN will buy the power later for distribution and this is really a pilot project in Indonesia,\" he said.

The Envision Group is a world-leading green technology company, as well as a zero carbon technology partner... The exploration of this collaboration was marked by the presence of Indonesia Region Senior Development Manager, Hermanto together with Envision Group Senior development manager, Nico Li. Both of them explained the potential of wind power recorded through satellite technology which they called Greenwich. \"Through this greenwich, we can see what the potential for wind power in Bantaeng is like. Therefore, we plan to develop a PLTB in Bantaeng Regency,\" explained Hermanto. He said, in general, Bantaeng has good wind power potential. He said, if this cooperation runs smoothly, then Bantaeng can have 67 PLTB points spread across a number of areas in Bantaeng Regency. \"With that potential, Bantaeng can supply as much as 867 MWH of electricity,\" he said... He added, the 67 PLTB towers being built will have an investment value of up to IDR 6.7 trillion. This investment value will have a positive impact on the socio-economic community in Bantaeng. \"We also want to participate in developing the Bantaeng industrial area which is zero carbon. With the existence of this PLTB, other investments will enter Bantaeng because we see Bantaeng as an environmentally friendly industrial area,\" he said. Meanwhile, the Regent of Bantaeng, Ilham Azikin welcomed the planned presence of the Envision Group in Bantaeng Regency. He said, Bantaeng is an area that is open to all investment opportunities. He admitted that he was interested in the PLTB development plan in Bantaeng. He even suggested being able to design PLTB development in the Bantaeng offshore area (Out Source)... Indonesia Region Senior Development Manager Envision Group, Hermanto shows the process of analyzing wind energy potential which is done digitally with the help of satellites. This analysis process is carried out with the help of an application called Greenwich. From the results of this analysis, almost all areas in Bantaeng have sufficient wind energy potential to build a PLTB. However, the picture from the Greenwich application must be strengthened by the construction of a wind measuring tower as a condition for applying for a permit at PT PLN. \"We have determined the location of this wind measuring tower. The point is in Bantaeng District,\" he explained. He said, in the near future, Envision will sign a collaboration with the Bantaeng Regency Government to start this project. After signing the agreement, Envision will start building this wind measuring tower.  \"This wind measuring tower will work for almost a year to ensure wind speed in Bantaeng,\" he explained.  Hermanto hopes that this cooperation with the Bantaeng Regency Government can be realized in the near future. He targets that this collaboration will be signed by the end of October.

Susiwijono said that his arrival at the Nonga Digital Park KEK was in order to follow up on the results of the meeting between the BP Batam Supervisory Board and the leadership within BP Batam. At the meeting, there was an agreement between the Supervisory Board and BP Batam to follow up on a number of potential new investments in the future. One of them is the potential for investment in the Nongsa Digital Park KEK. \"Because the Nongsa SEZ is our mainstay. \"Especially, related to the digital economy and also investments related to data centers and so on,\" explained Susiwijono.\nThe data center , which was built on an area of ​​28,730 square meters with an investment commitment of IDR 4 trillion from PT GDS IDC Service from Hong Kong, is a tier 3 data center with a capacity of 40 MW. This data center facility will be developed in two stages of 20 MW each. \"Earlier we saw that the progress was very good, so construction is really continuing. \"So we hope that this NDP KEK will encourage all sectors in Batam,\" explained Susiwijono. To support the smooth investment of the world's largest data center in the NDP SEZ, infrastructure support is needed to supply electrical energy and water. Regarding electricity and water needs, Susiwijono together with BP Batam and PLN Batam have discussed it, so that the supply that will be distributed to the NDP KEK can be maximally met.\nThis is done so that NDP SEZs can compete not only with neighboring countries such as Singapore and Malaysia. But it also competes with other world countries. “The government is very committed to continuing to encourage (fulfillment of needs) in order to increase competitiveness. \"So that our competitiveness can become an attraction for new investment here,\" explained Susiwijono.

But, disputes like this are not uncommon in Indonesia due to the lack of legal clarity, analyst said.\nKHE initiated in 2008 the Kayan Cascade project, which will consist of five dams along the Kayan River and equipped with five to six turbines.\nThe company in October 2022 signed an agreement with Sumitomo to co-develop the project, which is estimated to need around USD 17.8 billion in total investment. Prior to the agreement with Sumitomo, KHE had signed an agreement with China Power on 16 August 2019 for the same project, local media reported.\nYet, the company is still receptive to onboarding other investors into the mega project, t. It will prioritise potential investors who have already held talks with it or those who will be introduced by its partners, Suryali stated.\nInitial infrastructure works have been done and KHE plans to start constructing the first dam diversion channel this year, Suryali had said on the sidelines of the KHE-Sumitomo signing ceremony on 6 October in Jakarta.\nThe first plant will have 900-MW capacity; the second, 1,200MW; while the third and fourth will have 1,800 MW each, and the fifth 3,400 MW. The first project is expected to be completed in 2025 or 2026, depending on weather conditions, said KHE’s Director of Operations Khaeroni.\nKHE hoped to complete the rest of the project in two to three years after the completion of the first generation plant.\nThe power plants will supply electricity to the green industrial estate and an international sea port in North Kalimantan being developed by Indonesia Strategis Industri and other clients in Kalimantan, KHE said in a statement.\"", "Electricity Capacity (MW)": 0.0, "GEM": "Adaro Aluminum Smelter power station", "Latitude": 2.528752567, "Longitude": 117.8590457, "Sources": "https://infopublik.id/kategori/nusantara/701822/kunjungi-kipi-wabup-dan-tim-lakukan-evaluasi\nhttps://kilasdaerah.kompas.com/kalimantan-utara/read/2022/10/28/11450601/mengenal-lebih-dekat-perjalanan-kawasan-industri-raksasa-di-kaltara\nhttps://katadata.co.id/happyfajrian/ekonomi-hijau/633ff25058af9/kawasan-industri-akan-dipasok-listrik-ebt-demi-tingkatkan-nilai-produk\nhttps://korankaltara.com/7-investor-dikeluarkan-dari-kipi-tanah-kuning-mangkupadi\nhttps://korankaltara.com/kipi-dan-kihi-memiliki-pengertian-sama\nhttps://www.neraca.co.id/article/168461/bangun-smelter-aluminium-adaro-minerals-kuras-kocek-rp-163-triliun\nhttps://dephub.go.id/post/read/menhub-pastikan-kelancaran-perizinan-pembangunan-pelabuhan-kawasan-industri-kaltara\nhttps://katadata.co.id/tiakomalasari/berita/62b4346b08c50/pemerintah-kembangkan-kawasan-industri-di-kaltara-bakal-dihuni-ford\nhttps://www.teslarati.com/tesla-indonesia-battery-plant-location/\nhttps://www.industry.co.id/read/104950/teken-komitmen-investasi-capai-usd-728-juta-adaro-bakal-bangun-smelter-aluminium-di-kawasan-industri-hijau\nhttps://asia.nikkei.com/Economy/Indonesia-s-newest-province-chases-132bn-industrial-dream\nhttps://www.kompas.com/properti/read/2021/12/22/163000421/kawasan-industri-hijau-mulai-dibangun-di-kaltara-apa-itu-?page=2\nhttps://www.kominfo.go.id/content/detail/38900/presiden-groundbreaking-kawasan-industri-hijau-indonesia/0/berita\nhttps://www.fmprc.gov.cn/mfa_eng/wjdt_665385/wshd_665389/202211/t20221117_10976707.html\n(Archived link, 3/14/23) https://web.archive.org/web/20230314002433/https://petrominer.com/teken-mou-dengan-adaro-komitmen-iklim-hyundai-dipertanyakan/\nhttps://tanahair.net/kayan-river-hydropower-source-of-green-energy-at-kipi/\nhttps://www.reuters.com/business/energy/indonesia-president-breaks-ground-construction-26-bln-hydropower-plant-2023-03-01/\nhttps://www.ft.com/content/214da7e7-c858-452c-9aff-e6dab9b805e4\nhttps://news.mongabay.com/2023/06/indonesian-coal-giant-adaros-sustainable-smelter-slammed-as-greenwashing/\n(Archived link, 3/29/24) https://web.archive.org/web/20240329043346/https://www.adaro.com/files/news/berkas_eng/2206/Information%20Disclosure%20Signing%20Facility%20Agreements.pdf\n(Archived link, 102/23) https://web.archive.org/web/20231002215935/https://www.ptkhn.com/news/indonesia-president-joko-widodo-breaks-ground-on-construction-of-mentarang-induk-hydroelectric-plant-the-largest-plta-in-indonesia-with-a-capacity-of-1375-mw/\nhttps://asia.nikkei.com/Business/Energy/Japan-s-Sumitomo-joins-17.8bn-Indonesia-hydropower-project\nhttps://www.ft.com/content/1a8c599c-cd56-4b94-85fd-7d9d398312eb\nhttps://tanahair.net/kayan-hydro-energy-resuming-9000-mw-hydropower-project/\nhttps://www.business-humanrights.org/en/latest-news/indonesia-chinese-backed-hydropower-plant-supplying-electricity-to-new-capital-raises-displacement-and-environmental-concerns-among-indigenous-communities-on-kayan-river/\nhttps://apnews.com/article/indonesia-green-industrial-park-coal-09361a5098d6540d4ae3a1805b137788\nhttps://www.rfa.org/english/news/china/indonesia-china-borneo-03012023014556.html\nhttps://en.antaranews.com/news/274161/bulungan-kipi-future-of-green-industry-widodo\n(Broken) https://www.adaro.com/files/news/berkas_eng/2146/ADRO%20ADMR%20Sept%202022.pdf\n(Archived link, 3/29/24) https://web.archive.org/web/20240329043346/https://www.adaro.com/files/news/berkas_eng/2206/Information%20Disclosure%20Signing%20Facility%20Agreements.pdf\nhttps://www.apindokaltara.com/berita/read/kipi-akan-gandeng-pengusaha-lokal-kaltara\nhttps://www.gem.wiki/Adaro_Aluminum_Smelter_power_station\nhttps://www.energytransitionpartnership.org/uploads/2022/09/The-Electricity-Infrastructure-Planning-and-Investment-Needs-to-Support-Energy-Transition.pdf \nhttps://www.reuters.com/business/energy/indonesia-president-breaks-ground-construction-26-bln-hydropower-plant-2023-03-01/" }, "geometry": { "type": "Point", "coordinates": [ 117.8590457, 2.528752567 ] } },

The first initiation of this power plant, boasting a capacity of 15 megawatts (MW), took place in December 2022.\nThe second phase of the power plant initiation, generating 75 MW this time, will follow on the first quarter of 2023.\"", "Electricity Capacity (MW)": 15.0, "GEM": "East Halmahera power station", "Latitude": 0.8430947606, "Longitude": 128.2494734, "Sources": "https://www.antam.com/uploads/proyek-pengembangan-antam.pdf\nhttps://www.antam.com/en/news-and-events/article/perkembangan-penyelesaian-proyek-pabrik-feronikel-haltim---\nhttps://www.idnfinancials.com/news/45587/antam-sets-haltim-ferronickel-plant-operation-h\nhttps://www.tandaseru.com/2021/04/07/lumpur-setinggi-2-meter-di-bibir-pantai-warga-halmahera-timur-demo-antam/\nhttps://www.ekuatorial.com/en/2021/07/east-halmahera-fishermen-face-the-brunt-of-environmental-degradation/\nhttps://www.ekuatorial.com/en/2021/07/electric-vehicle-dream-is-costing-east-halmahera-its-environment/\nhttps://www.antam.com/id/news-and-events/article/construction-of-east-halmahera-feronickel-project-begins\nhttps://web.pln.co.id/media/siaran-pers/2023/01/pasok-llistrik-untuk-produksi-nikel-pt-antam-di-halmahera-timur-pln-berhasil-relokasi-pembangkit-dan-siap-beroperasi\nhttps://www.halmaheranesia.com/2023/09/07/terancamnya-mata-air-wato-wato-halmahera-dari-industri-tambang/\nhttps://antam.com/en/information-transparency/development-projects\n(Archived link, 8/8/22) https://web.archive.org/web/20220808214234/https://www.fht-antam.com/page/operasional-1\nhttps://indonesiabusinesspost.com/risks-opportunities/antam-first-metal-tapping-at-halmahera-timur-feronickel-plant-unveiled/\nhttps://www.gem.wiki/East_Halmahera_power_station\nhttps://www.hariankepri.com/pt-bai-akan-bangun-industri-amunisi-di-bintan-dan-pltu-1-200-megawatt/\nhttps://www.alcircle.com/news/pln-agrees-to-supply-energy-to-pt-bintan-alumina-indonesia-until-2050-83509\nhttps://www.tandaseru.com/2021/04/07/lumpur-setinggi-2-meter-di-bibir-pantai-warga-halmahera-timur-demo-antam/ " }, "geometry": { "type": "Point", "coordinates": [ 128.2494734, 0.8430947606 ] } },

Subsequently, after inspecting many well-known international design and technical supporters, Lygend Resources finally decided to choose China ENFI, which has mastered core technologies and mature industrial application capabilities, to provide technology and undertake design and related work."\n\n(Daly et al., 5/19/2021, reuters.com): "China\u2019s Lygend Mining said on Wednesday its nickel and cobalt smelting project in Indonesia had made its first batch of mixed hydroxide precipitate (MHP), becoming the first high-pressure acid leach (HPAL) project in the country to reach production.\nThe $1.05-billion project on Obi island in the province of North Maluku is among several cobalt-nickel HPAL plants in nickel miner Indonesia that are under the spotlight as a source of supply for the burgeoning electric-vehicle battery sector.\n\u201cOur first batch of nickel and cobalt hydroxide products will be shipped to China soon, and gradually enter the global market,\u201d said Lygend\u2019s president Jiang Xinfang.\nJiang said that Lygend Resources and its Indonesian partner Harita Group plan to build other projects on Obi island to make nickel sulphate, precursors and stainless steel-related products.\n\u201cIt means that there is a viable path to produce battery grade nickel with a reasonably low capital cost and a relatively short project timeline,\u201d said independent consultant Steven Brown.\n\u201cWith the nickel market already in surplus, we can expect the nickel price to drop if the commissioning process continues at this pace,\u201d Brown added.\nLygend has been able to tap Chinese contractor Enfi Engineering Corp, which has experience in HPAL in Papua New Guinea, to design its project and benefit from relatively low-cost labour and nickel ore costs in Indonesia.\nLygend aims to reach first-phase annual capacity of 30,000-37,000 tonnes of MHP in the second half of 2021."\n\n(Suarez, 5/27/2022, chinadialogue.net): Tianjin electric Power Construction - 1,520 MW power plant\n"The first is an EPC agreement for Tianjin Electric Power Construction to construct a 1,520 MW nickel ore-supporting thermal power project in the Obi Island Industrial Park, signed on 14 February. No project technology is confirmed publicly, but the original proposal signed in 2018 by Ningbo Lygend and Indonesia\u2019s Harita Group for the Obi Island park did include a 4.2 GW allocation for coal plants."',

The disposal of factory liquid waste at Hyundai is not in accordance with regulations.\n"Hyundai admits its guilt," said Head of the Civil and Administrative Section of the Cikarang District Attorney Rolando Ritonga recently.\nRolando said, Hyundai did not extend the liquid waste disposal permit (IPL C). Hyundai\'s industrial waste has also exceeded the quality standard threshold.\n"Results of a study by the Ministry of Environment, the Cikadu river, which flows into the CBL river to the sea, is experiencing extraordinary pollution due to Hyundai\'s waste disposal," said Rolando.\nThe lawsuit was then settled for Rp. 2 billion\nOn June 6, 2014, the Bekasi Regency Government sued PT Hyundai Inti Development in a civil lawsuit with a compensation value of IDR 16 billion.\nPT Hyundai Inti Development is the manager of the Hyundai industrial area and is responsible for permitting the disposal of liquid waste from local factories.\nThe value of IDR 16 billion is determined based on calculations from the Ministry of Environment experts. "Compensation is calculated from 2010 to February 2014," said Rolando.\nInitially, the government and Hyundai negotiated out of court. Hyundai stated that it was only able to pay compensation of 147 million. The government refused.\nHyundai then increased its offer to Rp 200 million, but the government still refused. Finally, Hyundai agreed to Rp 400 million. The government still refuses.\n\u201cFinally brought to court. The government and Hyundai agreed on a figure of Rp 2 billion. It must be paid no later than November 2015. The money goes to the regional administration," said Rolando.\nIn addition to paying Rp 2 billion, Hyundai is required to repair the sewage system so there will be no more pollution. Within 8 months, the canal repair should be completed.\n"If it doesn\'t complete the repairs within the allotted time, Hyundai will have to pay Rp 5 billion. That\'s the deal," he said.\nPT Hyundai Inti Development\'s lawyer, Army Mulyanto, explained that his client had paid Rp. 1 billion to the West Java Bank (BJB) account belonging to the Bekasi Regency Government.\n"Hyundai has paid Rp. 1 billion in early October. The drawback, another Rp. 1 billion, is paid no later than 30 days after the first payment," said Army.\nAccording to the Army, Hyundai is also working on repairing the sewage channel that will flow into the Cikadu River as agreed with the government.\n\u201cHyundai will fulfill all the agreements. As for channel repairs, Hyundai is currently repairing them," said Army.\nJust to note, the Hyundai Bekasi industrial area was built by PT Hyundai Inti Development on an area of \u200b\u200b200 hectares in Bekasi Regency and was operational in 1991.\nPT Hyundai Inti Development is a joint venture between Hyundai Corporation (South Korea) and PT. Lippo Cikarang Tbk.\nPT Lippo Cikarang Tbk (Lippo Group) itself is a company that owns and manages a number of industrial estates in Bekasi Regency. These include the EJIP industrial area, Delta Silicon 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 and 7. This includes Hyundai.\nCurrently, Lippo Cikarang is also developing an area called Delta Silicon 8 on an area of \u200b\u200b250 hectares. (Res)',

A bona fide business group\u2014Lippo Group through PT Karawang Jabar Industrial Estate (KJIE) is in turmoil and trying to achieve its new business project\u2014the elite Rolling Hills housing complex in Karawang. On Tuesday (21/07/2020) A number of Lippo delegates came to the regent\'s office. A number of officials welcomed their arrival directly. Not many people know what the discussion points between the Lippo envoy and the officials at the regent\'s office were. However, it is alleged that one of them discussed the Rolling Hills housing development project, which allegedly did not yet have the supporting documents to issue a Building Construction Permit (IMB). One of the requirements is Andalalin and UKL/UPL. This project can be seen immediately if you enter via the West Karawang access to the main access to KIIC, to be precise at KJIE. Soil dumping or cut an fill has begun. "Three house buildings prepared as examples are already standing at the very front, to the east of the access to KIIC," said Askun. Backfilling was also carried out on the opposite side of the road west of San Diego Hills. About 62 hectares of land were set aside to build Rolling Hills. Including the provision of facilities such as shopping centers. Promos and product offers are spread everywhere. "Yes, there is a meeting," said one person who confirmed that there was a meeting between Lippo representatives and a number of officials. Legal practitioner, Asep Agustian (Askun) "asked the Karawang Regency Government not to be careless and just make it easier to issue permits," said Askun. even though the one who owns the business is the Lippo Group. You have to think about the impact, if it has the potential to cause flooding. \u201cWhoever takes care of the permit must comply with the procedures and rules. I also ask law enforcers not to be lax. You have to be involved in monitoring, it\'s impossible, for example, the class of Head of Intelligence at the Prosecutor\'s Office doesn\'t know. Call, ask for information. "That\'s the prosecutor\'s intelligence job," said Askun. He also asked law enforcement to monitor the Rolling Hills permit application process. \u201cWhoever owns it still has to comply with local government regulations. "Don\'t let people become victims again, so if the policy is changed, then change it," he said. "It\'s said that someone who got the power of attorney was from Karawang, that\'s the procedure that was followed," said Askun. Yang said there were people from Karawang who were also involved in taking care of the permits. Previously, the Head of DLHK Karawang, Wawan Setiawan, told the media crew "once expressed his frustration, because he sent a summons to the KJIE but was ignored, PT KJIE management never came to attend the DLHK Karawang summons," said Wawan.

The resolution of the land allocation issue is unclear.  In 2016, Tatang Sofyan, the Head of the Land Agency of Sukabumi Regency and Rudolf Imam Santoso, among others, were designated suspects by the Cibadak State Prosecutor's Office in a corruption case over potential bribery in the transfer of state HGU land from PT Tenjojaya in Tenjoyaya Village to PT Bogorindo Cemergland.\n\nBased on an article by Seputar Jagat MP (2021), it appears that the land, which was formerly owned by PT. Tenjojaya, should have been returned to the state and accessible to over 100 local village cultivators (who have worked on the land since the 1970s) when PT. Tenjojaya's HGU expired. Instead, the HGU was transferred to Rudolf Imam Santoso, the head of PT Bogorindo. In 2021, it was reported that the land that had been transfered to PT. Bogorindo included structures built by Tenjojaya residents, such as the village office and schools, and that the community requested compensation and information on the ownership status of the land. \n\nOn June 26, 2022, it was reported by Mata Investigasi that Patty Nurchalis disclosed that PT. Bogorindo Cemerland was obtained through corruption, based on numerous court decisions inpreceding years, and that the 299 hectares had been confiscated by the West Java High Prosecutor's Office since 2016. Additionally, in a letter to an Ombudsman at the West Java High Prosecutor's Office, \"Nurchalis emphasized that the Prosecutor's Commission issued a recommendation for the PT.

                                    'Environmental Impact:\nLow groundwater levels in Bandung, likely due to industrial activities.\nkompas.com, 6/2/2023: The groundwater level in Bandung has fallen by 60 percent, industry is suspected to be the cause\nThroughout the Cileunyi area to Rancaekek , Bandung Regency, West Java, the groundwater level has decreased(cone of depression) and is in the vulnerable category. Rita Susilawati, Head of the Center for Groundwater and Environmental Geology (PATGTL) at the Geological Agency, said that the lowering of the groundwater level, which is in a delicate condition, is due to excessive water withdrawal.  Rita revealed, based on the Groundwater Conservation Map of the Bandung\u2013Soreang Groundwater Basin (CAT) compiled by the Geological Agency in 2010, in the Cileunyi area and its surroundings there has been a decrease in the pressured groundwater level (deep groundwater or artesian) to around 60 meters below the ground surface. local.\nSo that the area, he continued, is a vulnerable area with a reduction rate of 40 percent to 60 percent from the initial condition. "This phenomenon was seen in several places, including around the Cileunyi area to the Rancaekek area and its surroundings," he said via text message, Monday (6/2/2023). According to him, the Rancaekek area and its surroundings have a confined aquifer system (deep aquifer or artesian) at a depth of around 50 to 150 meters.\nThis area is hydrogeologically an area of \u200b\u200bgroundwater discharge from the Bandung\u2013Soreang CAT. "The pattern of depressed groundwater flow (deep groundwater) in the plains of Rancaekek and its surroundings indicates a conical phenomenon of lowering the groundwater level which indicates very intensive groundwater extraction," he said. In fact, he continued, the Rancaekek area has experienced a decrease in the depressed groundwater level (deep/artesian groundwater) to more than 70 meters below the local ground level. This causes the area to be an area prone to damage with a reduction rate of 40 percent to more than 80 percent from the initial condition. His party said that after 2010, the Geology Agency did not carry out monitoring of groundwater conditions in the Cileunyi and Rancaekek areas which were included in the Bandung-Soreang CAT. That authority, continued Rita, belongs to the government of West Java Province. "Currently the authority to manage groundwater has changed to being based on river areas, and the Bandung area, which is included in the Citarum River area, becomes central authority, so that in 2023 the Geological Agency will again carry out groundwater monitoring activities in Bandung and its surroundings," he added. Water Conditions Rita added, the cause of the damaged groundwater conditions along Cileunyi to Rancaekek was due to excessive groundwater extraction in the area. Considering that there are many industrial buildings in the Rancaekek area , this does not rule out being the cause. However, continued Rita, it is necessary to further evaluate whether the industry is the cause of the decrease in the groundwater level in Cileunyi to Rancaekek. "To find out whether the industry is the main cause, further evaluation is needed, because if the industry complies with the groundwater withdrawal regulations set forth in the permit, it should not cause problems," he said. His party highlighted the rampant illegal and unlicensed groundwater extraction. "What must be paid attention to is illegal or unlicensed groundwater extraction which is still rife. Unlicensed drilled wells cannot control the discharge of groundwater pumping, so it has the potential to cause damage to groundwater conditions in an area," he concluded.',

                                    'Dispute with Indonesian government, Environmental Impact:\n\n(Kompas, 2009, nasional.kompas.com): Semarang City Government Summons Terboyo Industrial Area Manager\nThe Semarang City Government will summon the management of the Terboyo Industrial Area to ask for an explanation regarding the problems that investors have complained about. This problem could set a bad precedent for the city of Semarang if it is not addressed immediately. "Next week, we will invite industrial area managers and business representatives to a meeting to find a solution," said Semarang City Acting Regional Secretary, Harini Krisniati, at Semarang City Hall, Tuesday (8/9). Entrepreneurs in the Terboyo Industrial Area complained about road damage and environmental pollution which disrupted their production activities. Harini admitted that this problem must be addressed immediately as part of the Semarang City Government\'s commitment to investment development. According to Harini, improving social facilities and public facilities should be the responsibility of the management, in this case PT Merdeka Wirastama. "For this reason, the city government will urge the management to immediately improve the infrastructure. If the area becomes slum then the Semarang City Government will also be affected," he said. Bad precedent Member of the Regional People\'s Representative Council for the City of Semarang, Agung Budi Margono, emphasized that the problems in the Terboyo Industrial Area could set a bad precedent for the City of Semarang if they do not immediately receive a response from the city government, especially if the foreign investor intends to divert their investment to another area. "This does not only involve loss of investment. However, furthermore, the city government will also lose the trust of other investors as well as the problem of workers who are no longer absorbed," said Agung. Head of Development Planning Division III, Semarang City Regional Development Planning Agency, M Farchan, added that the management should be responsible for damage to infrastructure in industrial areas. Over the past two years, investors have complained about poor infrastructure and environmental pollution from coal dust. However, this was never taken seriously by the management or the city and provincial governments. "Representatives from the Central Java Provincial Government once came and looked at this area, but there was never any improvement," said the owner of PT Ebako Nusantara, a furniture company from Singapore, Lee Wo Fun. Apart from investors, residents in the surrounding area also felt the impact. Aslamiyah (21), a shop owner in an industrial area, admitted that coal dust made her child, Istiqomah (1), often cough and have difficulty breathing. "I was worried, so I wanted to have him checked by a doctor," he said."',

They complained about the presence of toxic and hazardous waste (B3) pollution which allegedly came from the iron smelting factory owned by PT Power Steel Indonesia in the Millennium Industrial Area.\n"In the morning or evening, the smoke from this iron smelting factory reaches my house. "Sometimes the pollution is so frequent and widespread that we are affected to the point of coughing," said Hermansyah, a resident of Peusar Village to journalists, last weekend.\nAccording to him, the impact of B3 waste pollution from the iron smelting factory is very environmentally unfriendly, so it can cause the air conditions in residential areas to become unhealthy.\nApart from that, the pollution produced by factory activities is also detrimental to the health of residents and the surrounding environment because it is suspected to contain toxic and dangerous materials (B3).\n"What makes us even more confused is that local government people know that this smelting factory is wrong, but they don\'t take any action," he said.\nAnother resident, Sutiyah (48), said that this air pollution condition had been occurring for several years. In fact, about three years ago residents demanded a meeting or mediation regarding the case of pollution at the iron smelting factory.\n"We had a meeting before. And the company compensates residents for damages, only that only once. "Now it\'s no longer there, the factory hasn\'t even improved its waste management," he said.\nMeanwhile, in a separate place, the Head of the Legal Development Section of the Tangerang Regency Environmental Cleanliness Service (DLHK), Sandi Nugraha, stated that from the results of checks and tests in the field, the company or steel smelting factory was found to have 10 smelting furnaces (furnaces) equipped with hoods which function to capture emissions. dust and smoke poured into the teapot (reservoir).\nHowever, dust or smoke emissions fly in the production area because the hood\'s ability to suck up dust does not operate normally. Thus, air pollution occurs which has a direct impact on the surrounding community.\n"The situation becomes worse when strong winds blow (usually from midday to afternoon) which causes dust or smoke to reach the environment around the factory," he said.\nHe said, apart from finding negligence, the testing team from DLHK also found five emission chimney units that did not comply with the technical provisions of Kepdal No. 205 of 1996, namely sampling holes, chimney codes, coordinate points, and supporting facilities (ladders, safety fences, and platform).\n"But at the time of our visit to the location the company was carrying out repairs on several chimneys," he said.\nNevertheless, he continued, with the discovery of several violations or negligence by the company, his party will continue to carry out supervision with a focus on monitoring improvements and improving air management resulting from production activities at the steel smelting factory.\nApart from that, his party also requires companies to periodically report environmental documents in accordance with existing/actual conditions every 6 (six) months to the Tangerang Regency DLHK or through the KLHK Environmental Electronic Reporting System (SIMPEL) portal.\n"Companies are required to improve the performance of the hood, which functions to capture dust and smoke emissions that are poured into the jug (container) to minimize dust emissions or smoke flying in the production area and the environment around the factory," he said."',

This is because the company that manages the Pasar Kemis industrial area, Tangerang, did not make financial reports or annual reports from 2008 to 2015.\nThis action is considered to be contrary to Law Number 40 of 2007 concerning Limited Liability Companies. On this basis, the minority shareholder, Gunarko Papan sued Siauly.\n"The panel of judges stated that the Plaintiff\'s claim was reasonable and proven regarding the Defendant never making Financial Reports and Annual Reports from 2008 to 2015 and sentenced the defendant to pay the plaintiff immediately and in cash Rp. 77 billion," said Gunarko Papan\'s lawyer, Bambang Siswanto in written statement to merdeka.com in Jakarta, Thursday (22/6).\nHe explained that the Director of PT PDP Siauly Papan did not implement the principle of disclosure of information (disclosure principle) and good corporate governance in terms of PT PDP\'s Annual Financial Report from 2008 to 2015 to the Plaintiff.\n"This is considered an attempt to discredit Gunarko Papan\'s position as a shareholder in the company. In fact, Siauly dares to insult Gunarko\'s credibility as a legal shareholder whose rights are protected by the company\'s Articles of Association," he stressed.\nBambang explained that Gunarko, as the holder of 17.36 percent of the shares, sued Siauly Papan and also sued Mutiara Papan, Mirawati Papan, who each own 17.36 percent of the shares and Dayakonsolindo Sumbersemesta as the holder of 30.56 percent of the shares of PT PDP.\n"Because the co-defendants are considered to be protecting the Director of PT PDP Siauly Papan," he explained."\n\nEnvironmental Impact:\nIn 2023, claims that Pasar Kemis was the most polluted area in South East Asia went viral on social media based on monitoring by the IQAir website. The head of the Tangerand Regency Environment and Hygiene Service clarified that these measurements were from 2022, and not accurate for 2023. The head of Pasar Kemis District admitted that air pollution was a big problem for the area, given its dense population and industrial areas, and said it would take coordination between government ad business actors to minimize air pollution (news.republika.co.id, 4/13/2023).\n\n(Republik, 4/13/2023, news.republika.co.id): The Most Polluting Kemis Market in Southeast Asia, DLHK Tangerang: Data is Invalid\n"Head of the Tangerang Regency Environment and Hygiene Service (DLHK), Achmad Taufik, claims that the status of air pollution in the Pasar Kemis area is not as bad as the information that has gone viral on social media (medsos). Based on monitoring of the IQAir website and application on Monday (10/04/2023) at 10:00 WIB, the air pollution status in the Pasar Kemis area was at moderate conditions (PM 2.5, namely 32.2 ug/m3 micro gram). \n"This is different from the data uploaded on social media which named Pasar Kemis District, Tangerang Regency as the most polluted area in Southeast Asia," said Taufik in his statement received by Republika , Wednesday (12/4/2023).\nAccording to Taufik, the data that is widely uploaded on social media is old data, namely data for the period 2022. So, he continued, the data submitted by the reporter from social media Instagram is data from 2022 which is no longer valid.\nHe also clarified the data uploaded by seastats and seasia.co on his Instagram social media account, that Pasar Kemis District is the most polluted area in Southeast Asia in 2022 with a PM 2.5 particles value of 49.6.\nTaufik said that the ranking status of IQAir results at the Pasar Kemis location in Tangerang Regency was not on the top most polluted ranking list. He claimed that the Tangerang Regency Government through DLHK could create a comfortable and beautiful living environment.\n"Thank God, this is something we need to be grateful for, as part of our joint efforts, it can be seen from the data that we have checked the system IQ results which are still below air quality standards," said Taufik.\nIn line with the statement of the Head of DLHK, Head of Pasar Kemis District, Sony Karsan, said that collaboration between various parties is needed to minimize air pollution in Pasar Kemis District.\nConsidering that the Pasar Kemis area is a densely populated area and also an industrial area in Tangerang Regency. Nevertheless, his party admits that the air pollution problem in the Pasar Kemis District area will take a long time to overcome. \n"Given that from a geographical perspective this area is an industrial area and is densely populated, this is what causes pollution in the Pasar Kemis District area to be poor. Therefore cooperation and collaboration is needed from various parties," he said.\nHe also said that the Government continues to encourage efforts related to environmental problems in Pasar Kemis District, one of which is by providing education and giving advice to business actors and community members to plant trees in their respective environments.\n"Currently we are also coordinating and communicating with the Tangerang Regency DLHK to provide education to business actors so that they can plant trees in their respective environments," he said.\nMeanwhile, for motor vehicle pollution, the government\'s efforts are being encouraged to carry out emissions tests on motor vehicles in certain areas, especially in the Pasar Kemis area."',

Muhara, Sunday (22/5/2022).\nSopian, the owner of the rice field, who is also a local resident, said that the water overflowed and inundated his parents\' rice field as a result of the PT Irama Gemilang Lestari (IGL) industrial area construction project, resulting in landslides and narrowing of the Muhara river.\nOther rice field owners, Arumi and Budin, also felt the same thing. They admitted that they had been so badly affected that they were no longer able to grow crops due to flooding or overflowing waters of the Muhara River.\n"The Muhara River, which used to be approximately 8 meters wide, has now shrunk to approximately 2 meters and due to heavy rain, the land around the industrial area collapsed and covered the river basin (DAS) so that the river water rose and flooded my parents\' rice fields," complained Sopian. .\nSopian said that at the beginning of the construction of the industrial area, he had said that the river should be tidied up first, so that the residents\' rice fields would not be flooded, but the developer ignored this.\n"We hope that the government will be sensitive, because currently residents still need agricultural land as a source of income for residents," he explained.\nMeanwhile, Dudung, a youth leader from Cileles Village, claimed that the local government was not sensitive to the effects or impacts of the IGL industrial area project. Dudung asked the government to look at the affected locations and find a solution."\n\nEnvironmental Impact:\nDue to the development of the industrial park, land collapsed near the river, resulting in the river overflowing and flooding villagers\' cropland, ruining their crops.',

                                    'Dispute with local residents, land acquisition issues:\n\nbantennews.co.id, 3/15/2023: Land Acquisition by PT Pancapuri Indoperkasa, Residents Trapped by Brokers\nThe Cilegon DPRD\'s facilitation of the polemic regarding land acquisition for residents in a number of neighborhoods in Gunung Sugih Village, Ciwandan District with PT Pancapuri Indoperkasa has entered a new phase. In a public hearing on Wednesday (15/3/2023), residents revealed that there was a practice of brokering in the land acquisition process so that they suffered losses.\nSayuti, one of the residents, said that as a result of this practice, he only received IDR 100 million in December 2020, for the down payment for the acquisition of his approximately 5,000 square meter land from PT Pancapuri Indoperkasa through Rusli, a broker. This value is far from the initially agreed price, namely IDR 1.49 billion.\n"Even though I have never given any power of attorney to Rusli. "That\'s why I keep asking what happens to the remaining payments," he said.\nIt was explained that after investigating it, it was later discovered that the management of PT Pancapuri Indoperkasa had paid off its obligations through Rusli\'s savings account, but unfortunately the amount was not as expected, namely only IDR 1.1 billion, which was suddenly rejected by Sayuti.\n\u201cYes, of course we don\'t want to. Moreover, there is already an agreement that if the completion process is later than 2020, the price will be adjusted, even though we are not discussing this issue. "We only demand rights," he said.\nRusli was also present at the hearing. In his statement, he said that the emergence of the problem was triggered by pressure on repayment by Sayuti and the payment pattern which was paid in installments and bailed out by individual employees of PT Pancapuri Indoperkasa with certain considerations so that the value did not match what Sayuti expected.\n\u201cAfter continuing to pay in installments for two years, finally I was confused. Because the family didn\'t want to accept it, they didn\'t want to return it to Pancapuri, so in the end the money was returned to me. "Later, if the price is right, then I will give it to my family, this was my mistake at that time," said Rusli.\nFrom this brokering practice, Rusli explained that he received a wage of IDR 5 thousand per meter from PT Pancapuri Indoperkasa. Furthermore, he even admitted the truth regarding him not holding a power of attorney from Sayuti. This was because his role as a broker for around 50 other land owners had long been known to many residents, long before he had any dealings with Sayuti.\n\u201cEssentially, I admit that I was wrong, and I fully understand the implications of the actions I have committed. In fact, from the start I told the family, if you want to report it to the police, you can. "If it were me, I wouldn\'t be running anywhere, in fact it would be clear to see who is playing at Pancapuri," he explained.\nMeanwhile, the Chairman of Commission I of the Cilegon DPRD, Masduki, hopes that this issue will reveal the dark veil of the polemic about land acquisition for residents by PT Pancapuri Indoperkasa which has not yet been resolved.\n"What\'s even more strange is why Pancapuri can go to him (transact with Rusli), even though he doesn\'t have a power of attorney. But this is one of the cases, it could be that the previous problem also had a model like this. Well, everything will be revealed as to who the land mafia is, including the 50 residents (facilitated by brokers) who actually need to be investigated, but that\'s not in our area. It\'s possible that the polemic that arose at Mount Sugih was because of casuistry like this. "From Pancapuri, it was completed but not delivered," said Masduki.\nUnfortunately, the hearing which was attended by the Regional Financial and Asset Management Agency (BPKAD), the Head of the Legal Section of the Regional Secretariat of Cilegon City, the National Land Agency (BPN) of Cilegon City, Subdistricts and Districts was not also attended by the management of PT Pancapuri Indoperkasa.\n"Even if Pancapuri cannot attend today without news and confirmation, we will invite him back later, and I will coordinate with the leadership," explained this PAN politician.\n\n(BantenNews, 9/22/2022, bantennews.co.id): PT Pancapuri Indoperkasa Regrets Blocking Project Access by Cilodan Residents\n"Dozens of residents of the Cilodan Neighborhood RT 18/05 Gunung Sugih Village, Ciwandan District, Cilegon City on Thursday (22/9/2022) blocked an environmental road which has been the access for PT Pancapuri Indoperkasa\'s heavy vehicle mobility for the development project of PT Chandra Asri Petrochemical ( CAP) 2.\nThe residents had to carry out the action of blocking the road and unfurling a banner containing the demands because it was confirmed that PT Pancapuri Indoperkasa had not completed its obligation to acquire the land belonging to the residents.\n"The road has been used by Pancapuri for the road project, while my extended family, around 20 of the houses above, have not been released, that doesn\'t include the families below. We are disturbed by the dust from the project," said Dani Adhani (63), a resident to BantenNews.co.id.\nAccording to Dani, his decision was unanimous regarding the acquisition value of approximately 3,000 square meters of land belonging to his family. However, the value offered has not yet received a response from PT Pancapuri Indoperkasa.\n\u201cThose who come to us are all brokers, not A1, whose Pancapuri people are. If you are a broker, you know yourself. Meanwhile, if my family has clearly asked for the figure of Rp. 5 million per meter, and that\'s okay, it doesn\'t count as house buildings. That\'s why we are blocking it, so it\'s better to just close it first," he explained.\nAccording to Dani Adhani, the majority of local residents have left their homes after receiving payment for their release from PT Pancapuri Indoperkasa. "All that\'s left here is my family, along with Haji Ismat\'s family, Sayani, the others have all been released," he said.\nUntil this news was released, the Director of PT Pancapuri Indoperkasa, Abraham Sinatrawan, confirmed via his cellphone that he had not responded to calls and WhatsApp messages sent by journalists."\n',

In 2018, local resident protests after a local police chief  was dismissed due to potential collaboration between Ketapang police and Suzhou Police in Jiangsu, China.\n\n(Kiwi, 4/1/2020, suarapemredkalbar.com): "Sungai Awan Kanan Residents Threaten to Close PT JZD, Smell of Waste Up to a 3 Kilometer Radius"\n"KETAPANG, SP - Residents of Sungai Awan Kanan Village, Muara Pawan District, Ketapang Regency threatened to close PT Indonesia Jiazhaode Agriculture and Forestry Industrial Development (JZD). The reason is, every day the stench from the waste of companies that produce tapioca flour wafts up to a 3 kilometer radius.PT JZD, which operates in the area of \u200b\u200bPT Ketapang Ecology and Agriculture Forestry Industrial Park (KIP) Group, is considered ignorant when it comes to residents\' complaints about waste."We see that this company is not ready for production, because they cannot handle production waste. So that it has an impact on air pollution for the community," said Ratam, a resident of Sungai Awan Kanan Village, Wednesday (1/4).Ratam said that the bad smell spread to the community\'s settlements. Not only the community around the company, such as Sungai Awan Kanan Village, but the community outside the company environment.\u201cThe smell of this sewage can reach Payak Kumang and Sukaharja villages. A radius of 2-3 kilometers still smells of the waste," he explained.Ratam assessed that the waste caused an odor because it was not managed properly by the company. Maybe the company just doesn\'t understand. However, said Ratam, it could also be intentional and does not care about the environment.\n\u201cBesides the stench, the information we heard was that there were dead community plants around the waste disposal site. We are worried that the waste storage pond is not up to standard. If it breaks, the waste will go straight into the Pawan River. We are afraid that the river water will become polluted," he complained. Residents admitted that they had submitted several demands to the management of PT JZD and the owner of the PT KIP Group area, to temporarily close PT JZD\'s operations. Apart from that, the residents asked the company to take responsibility for eliminating the stench. This is in the interest of the community," he said. Ratam revealed, PT JZD only employs a dozen people. Because, more work using machines. "So don\'t make excuses about the workforce," he said.\nSanctions for Closing Operations Staff of the Planning and Environmental Impact Study Section of the Ketapang Regency People\'s Housing, Settlement Areas and Environment (Perkim-LH) Office, Yuan Again, said that his agency had already inspected PT JZD\'s waste disposal site. Sanctions for closing the company\'s operations in the PT KIP Group area, Muara Pawan District may be imposed. "Crucially, the waste in the tapioca industry is stored in the ponds that were made, but the processing is still manual and does not meet the waste treatment specifications," he stressed. Yuan continued, the company\'s waste creates an unpleasant odor that spreads to residential areas. Even up to a fairly far radius. As a result of checking the field, the Perkim-LH Service will submit a letter of recommendation to the management of PT JZD, including PT KIP as the owner of the area so that the waste does not flow into the pond, until the company can manage the waste properly. Our recommendation, no more waste disposal in the pool. Even the waste that has already been dumped in several ponds, we ask them to cover it with tarpaulins and take care of it, so that the smell doesn\'t spread," he explained. Yuan added, a letter of recommendation would be sent by his side this week to the company, and asked the company to follow this recommendation. "They are obliged to do so. follow our recommendations. If they are not heeded and waste is still flowing, then the sanction may be closed completely," he said.

The National Police denied agreeing to such collaboration. \u201c[Sunario] has been dismissed from his position because he violated the rules,\u201d National Police spokesman Brig. Gen. Muhammad Iqbal said on Friday.  The picture depicts what appears to be a sign at the entrance to an office that establishes the building as a "Joint Police Office".

The sign also mentioned the \u201cKetapang Ecology and Agriculture Forestry Industrial Park\u201d,  a company that produces plywood, glue, tapioca starch and clean water, among other things. Chinese investors built the factory and invested Rp 4.5 trillion (US$311,000) into the company.

The reason is, every day the stench from the waste of companies that produce tapioca flour wafts up to a 3 kilometer radius.PT JZD, which operates in the area of \u200b\u200bPT Ketapang Ecology and Agriculture Forestry Industrial Park (KIP) Group, is considered ignorant when it comes to residents\' complaints about waste."We see that this company is not ready for production, because they cannot handle production waste. So that it has an impact on air pollution for the community," said Ratam, a resident of Sungai Awan Kanan Village, Wednesday (1/4).Ratam said that the bad smell spread to the community\'s settlements. Not only the community around the company, such as Sungai Awan Kanan Village, but the community outside the company environment.\u201cThe smell of this sewage can reach Payak Kumang and Sukaharja villages. A radius of 2-3 kilometers still smells of the waste," he explained.Ratam assessed that the waste caused an odor because it was not managed properly by the company. Maybe the company just doesn\'t understand. However, said Ratam, it could also be intentional and does not care about the environment.\n\nPotentially related to PT.

BMP and CV. KQP Sells Backfill Land to PT. KBS\n"Stockpile material for the Smelter Construction site in the PT Industrial Area. Ketapang Bangun Sarana / PT. Borneo Alumindo Prima in Pagar Mentimun Village, MHS District, Ketapang Regency, West Kalimantan is strongly suspected of being purchased from a problematic quarry.\nThe stockpiled material at the Smelter location is supplied from Tiga Quarry in the Kendawangan District area, Ketapang Regency. Two of the quarries are strongly suspected of having problems with the legality of licensing.\nThe three quarries are, IUP-OP Laterit a,n Ismail (CV. Joss Kendawangan), then IUP-OP Tanah Urug PT. Bahtera Multi Pacific (PT. BMP) transported by CV. Khai Boenak, as well as IUP-OP Tanah Urug CV. Kendawangan Quarindo Perkasa (CV. KQP) which was transported by CV. Prime Pearl Light.\nOf the three Quarry permits, two of them had problems because their permits had been revoked by the Ministry of BKPM-RI. Both permits belong to PT. Bahtera Multi Pacific (PT. BMP) and CV. Kendawangan Quarindo Perkasa (CV. KQP).\nResults confirmed by the media team to the DPM PTSP West Kalimantan Province represented by Franky SimanjuntaknS.STP Functional licensing administrator for young experts DPM PTSP capital investment department\n(17/10), "data was obtained that both permits (PT. BMP and PT. KQP) had a permit status of "YET RECOVERY" after being revoked by the Ministry of BKPM-RI," \u200b\u200bhe said.\nMeanwhile, one more permit, an ISMAIL individual, has active status and is not included in the list of permit revocations by the Ministry of BKPM-RI.\n\nIsmail is a Commander at CV. Joss Kendawangan. IUP-OP Ismail has also received approval for the 2023 RKAB document.\nThen the media team also confirmed to the West Kalimantan Province ESDM Service (17/10), One permit in the name of PT. Bahtera Multi Pasifik (PT. BMP) belongs to SUBRATA, apart from having not yet restored its permit after its permit was revoked. PT. This BMP also did not pocket the 2023 RKAB, while up to now its activity has been high production (tens of thousands of cubic meters).\nEspecially CV. Kendawangan Quarindo Perkasa (CV. KQP) was informed by the West Kalimantan Province ESDM Service to journalists (17/10), that CV. KQP has obtained the 2023 RKAB document even though its permit status has not been restored after being revoked by the Ministry of BKPM-RI on June 2 2022.\nOther information received from the West Kalimantan Province ESDM Service is that CV. KQP has also obtained a Decree to Cancel the Revocation since September 29 2022. Ironically, until now its status has not been restored at the West Kalimantan DPMPTSP. This raises a big question mark regarding the validity of the Cancellation Decree, and the process of obtaining it.\nC excavation activities carried out by PT. BMP and CV. KQP is in the public spotlight because its permit status is problematic. The activities of these two companies are suspected to be illegal.\nActivities without permits can result in losses for the state in terms of tax revenues. It is suspected that billions of rupiah could be lost to the state, because the company works illegally, the taxes do not go to the state.\nAccording to public information, it is strongly suspected that there are backing individuals behind this illegal activity.\n"The activities are visible, it is impossible for the authorities not to know, the impression is negligence. "What\'s going on?... we\'ll just have to wait and see if there is any action from APH," said a Ketapang resident who did not want to be named.

BORNEO ALUMINDO PRIMA (HANGZHOU JINJIANG GROUP) WAS ALLEGEDLY BUILT USING FILLED MATERIALS FROM ILLEGAL EXCAVATIONS\nThe aluminum factory and special port construction project located in Pagar Mentimun Village, Matan Hilir Selatan District, Ketapang Regency, this is in accordance with the Ketapang Regent\'s Land Information Decree Number 654.1/35/DPU-E covering an area of \u200b\u200b2,340 hectares and the Ketapang Regent\'s location permit decree Number 249/PEM/2013 covering an area of \u200b\u200b1,150 hectares, which is managed by PT. BORNEO ALUMINDO PRIMA and PT. KETAPANG BANGUN PRIMA which are companies incorporated in HANGZHOU JINJIANG GROUP CO., LTD which is based in the city of Lin\'an, Zhejiang province, China.\nIn this project, HANGZHOU JINJIANG GROUP CO., LTD in the initial stage invested funds amounting to 1,250 million USD which was intended for the construction of an industrial area, an aluminum factory with a capacity of 4.5 million tons per year, the construction of a 15 x 25 MW PLTU and the construction of a special port.\nIt is planned that the aluminum industry which is managed by the company PT. BORNEO ALUMINDO PRIMA, whose raw material is bouxite, will be supplied by 9 companies including Pt. Tamindo Mutiara Perkasa, Pt. Fortuna Jaya Makmur, Pt. Kindai Mandiri Sejahtera 290, Pt. Kindai Mandiri Sejahtera 291, Pt. Agrabudi Gasutama Prima, Pt. Cakrawala Mandiri Sedaya, Pt. Tayan Alumina Abadi and Pt. Meliau Ratu Abadi with a total production plan of 10 million tons per year.\nThe construction that is currently being carried out is still at the land preparation stage, including land clearing work as well as filling and other initial construction work, but what is very unfortunate is that the supply of materials used for filling work is suspected to have been supplied from unofficial or illegal excavation sites. Based on research by national media OBORKEADILAN.COM, the mining location for the stockpiled material comes from behind the Miftaluh Ulum Islamic boarding school, Gayam hamlet, Sungai Gantang Village, Kendawangan District, where the location also belongs to the Islamic boarding school foundation.\nAccording to the confession of one of the administrators of the Miftaluh Ulum Islamic boarding school foundation, who did not want to be named, he said that "the excavation does not have a mining permit nor does it have an environmental permit as it should, but the fees obtained from the sale of the laterite land will be used to build the development of the Islamic boarding school facilities." he said. \nMeanwhile, according to Ibrahim, Myh, who is the coordinator of the Nusantara Corruption Watch (NCW) for the West Kalimantan region, said that the laterite mining activity did not have a Mining Business Permit (IUP) in accordance with Law Number 4 of 2009 concerning Mineral and Coal Mining (Minerba) as well. Government Regulation (PP) Number 23 of 2010 concerning the Implementation of Mineral and Coal Mining Business Activities, along with Law Number 28 of 2009 concerning Taxes and Levies and what is no less important is the existence of an environmental permit from the Kendawangan district government or the West Kalimantan Regency Government, however "None of these things are owned by the excavation manager," he said irritably.\nMonitoring in the field of excavation activities using excavator type heavy equipment and transported by dozens of dump truck type vehicles going back and forth to the landfill site via public roads which created dust and no watering activities were carried out by the management of excavation C. According to several residents, the excavation was coordinated by someone named Mr. Deril alias Maxklem alias Mc lean D. Meray is suspected of being a thug and is the third hand in collecting PT. BORNEO ALUMINDO PRIMA\'s laterite excavation.\nAt a different time, in the room of the Ketapang Police Chief, AKBP Yuri Nurhidayat, when confirmed by several media crew regarding the existence of mining activities that did not have legality, in one statement he said, "You need to know that the issue of permitting Excavation C in our area is very complicated and takes a long time. In the Kendawangan area and its surroundings, there are no business entities or individuals who have a C mining business permit that have received a production permit. I have raised this issue at the Forkopimda meeting. "C mining/excavation activities may not have a permit as long as they are not supplied outside the area or are not bought and sold outside the area and the issue of controlling mining that does not have a permit is the authority of the local government through Satpol PP," he said. \nUntil the time this news was published, excavation activities supplied to industrial and port construction sites managed by PT BORNEO ALUMINDO PRIMA were still ongoing even though the materials used were sourced from excavations that did not have clear legality in accordance with the provisions of Government Regulation No. 1 of 2014 regarding the second amendment to PP no. 23 of 2010 concerning the implementation of mineral and coal mining business activities, Law Number 4 of 2009 concerning Mineral and Coal Mining (State Gazette of the Republic of Indonesia of 2009 Number 4, Supplement to the State Gazette of the Republic of Indonesia Number 49), Law Number 32 of 2009 concerning Environmental Protection and Management (State Gazette of the Republic of Indonesia of 2009 Number 140, Supplement to the State Gazette of the Republic of Indonesia Number 5059)."',

PT ATI had submitted relevant documents, but the council was still waiting on documents from PT Mega Nur, which as of 2020 was not operational. PT Mega Nur claimed that PT. ATI failed to ask permission before undertaking construction that hindered the activities of PT. Mega Nur on its 20 ha. Separately, the surrounding community expressed it\'s desire to hand over PT. Mega Nur\'s land to PT. ATI, since PT. Mega Nur has been in and out of operation since 2017.\n\nDispute with local residents:\n(San, 1/17/2023, edisiindonesia.id): Sambalagi Community Asks PT Anugrah Tambang Industri to Stop Activities\nThe people of Sambalagi Village, Bungku Pesisir District, Morowali Regency asked PT Anugrah Tambang Industri (ATI) to temporarily stop its activities.\nAccording to the Sambalagi Community Coordinator, Irfan Mualim, PT ATI\'s presence in Sambalagi Village is expected to have a positive impact, not only on improving the economy of the local community.\n"However, the economic impact has never been seen, only the impact of pollution and the noise that exists after the demolition of several mountains in Sambalagi Village," said Irfan Mualim, in his written statement, Tuesday (17/1/2023).\nFurthermore, he said, heavy equipment continues to roar non-stop 1 x 24 hours, disrupting people\'s sleep. Even the encroachment of mangrove forests (mangroves) and seagrass beds (lelamo) poses a real threat to Sambalagi Village due to natural disasters.\n"In fact, in several areas, mangroves and lelamo are also protected and President Joko Widodo has often called for them to be protected together for the benefit of the community. "Therefore, it would not be wrong if the people of Sambalagi Village asked PT Anugrah Tambang Industri to conduct socialization regarding plans for industrial area development activities in collaboration with PT Vale Indonesia," he said.\nHe explained that in July 2022, the Sambalagi Village Government had sent a letter to the leadership of PT Anugrah Tambang Industri regarding the request for this socialization. However, in various meetings held, the leadership of PT ATI and the Sambalagi Village aparta only made promises.\n"In fact, we held a public consultation at the Lafeu Village Office, a sub-district location which was attended by the Regent of Morowali and the Head of Bungku Pesisir Sub-District. "I don\'t know whether they want to move the planned smelter factory to that village, or it\'s a speculative effort carried out by PT ATI," he said.\nFor this and with patience, he added the Sambalagi Village Government. Then, he sent a second letter on January 6 2023, with the same request, namely urging PT ATI to socialize the community.\nHowever, the Head of the Public Relations Department of PT Anugrah Tambang Industri, Margono alias Ahong, replied to the Sambalagi Village Government\'s letter which disappointed the Sambalagi community.\nThe contents of the letter are for the Sambalagi Village Government to write to the Regent of Morowali to facilitate requests for community outreach to PT Anugrah Tambang Industri. This is impressive, because the Regent of Morowali was the facilitator of this socialization activity.\n"As far as we know, socialization is a necessity that must be carried out by every company when they want to carry out activities in the village," he explained.\nHe added that socialization also makes local people know and understand what will be built or erected in the village. So that society can face the impacts that will occur.\n"Because of this, we, the people of Sambalag Village, have asked PT Anugrah Tambang Industri to temporarily stop mountain demolition activities before carrying out outreach to the Sambalag Village community," he stressed.\n"And the Morowali Regional People\'s Representative Council (DPRD) will immediately hold a\nhearing meeting by inviting the people of Sambalagi Village regarding the\nencroachment of mangrove forests and seagrass beds in Sambalagi Village," he said.\n\nEnvironmental Impact:\nPotential destruction of mangroves\nedisiindonesia.id, 1/17/2023: Sambalagi Community Asks PT Anugrah Tambang Industri to Stop Activities\nThe people of Sambalagi Village, Bungku Pesisir District, Morowali Regency asked PT Anugrah Tambang Industri (ATI) to temporarily stop its activities.\nAccording to the Sambalagi Community Coordinator, Irfan Mualim, PT ATI\'s presence in Sambalagi Village is expected to have a positive impact, not only on improving the economy of the local community.\n"However, the economic impact has never been seen, only the impact of pollution and the noise that exists after the demolition of several mountains in Sambalagi Village," said Irfan Mualim, in his written statement, Tuesday (17/1/2023).\nFurthermore, he said, heavy equipment continues to roar non-stop 1 x 24 hours, disrupting people\'s sleep.

                                    'Workers\' rights dispute:\nWorker conflicts, written complaints due to negative environmental impact from coal dust and water pollution.\n\n(Asiatoday, 3/22/2023, asiatoday.id): The Morosi Nickel Industrial Area is Turbulent, 2 Groups of PT VDNI and PT OSS Workers Clash\nA tense situation occurred in the Morosi nickel industrial area, Konawe Regency, Southeast Sulawesi.\nTwo groups of workers working at PT Virtue Dragon Nickel Industry (VDNI) and PT Obsdian Stainless Steel (OSS) were involved in a clash on Wednesday (22/3/2023).\nThe clash was triggered by a strike by thousands of workers held by the National Workers\' Union (KSPN) and the Labor Protection Union (SPTK). This action sparked a reaction of resistance from opposing labor groups. As a result, clashes were inevitable.\nHundreds of police officers intervened to mediate between the two warring camps.\nThe workers\' strike action was to urge the management of PT VDNI and PT OSS to provide family allowances, transportation allowances and housing allowances to workers. The workers also asked the company to carry out Collective Labor Agreement (PKB) negotiation procedures in accordance with Minister of Manpower Regulation (Permenaker) No. 28 of 2014, and urged the central management leadership to remove the HRD position of PT. OSS and PT. VDNI in Morosi.\nFor your information, these two nickel refining companies, PT VDNI and PT OSS, are located in the Morosi industrial area. PT VDNI was founded in 2014 and is a subsidiary of De Long Nickel Co Ltd which originates from Jiangsu, China. This company invested tens of trillions of rupiah to build a smelter facility with modern technology. Its production capacity is 600,000-800,000 tons of nickel pig iron per year. Until the end of 2018, PT VDNI had contributed US$142.2 million to Indonesian exports.\nThe parent companies of PT OSS are Hong Kong Xiangyu Hansheng Co Ltd and Singapore Xiangyu Hansheng Pte Ltd. This company was founded in 2016 in an area of \u200b\u200b398 hectares with an investment value of US$ 2 billion. Since 2018, this company has applied for a principle permit to build a 400,000 ton stainless steel production facility, 800,000 ton steel lab and 800,000 ton ferronickel. To date, PT OSS has built 17 smelter furnaces out of the planned 30 furnaces.\nMeanwhile, Arys Nirwana, Head of Human Resources Department PT VDNI and PT OSS, in his release explained that what was conveyed by the action participants did not match the facts. This is because, for example, the company has good intentions and is open to discussing this matter as long as the labor union fulfills the requirements in accordance with applicable laws and regulations.\nIn every meeting held at the company, at the Konawe Regency Manpower Office and the Provincial DPRD Hearing Meeting, the company complied with the summons and acted cooperatively.\nFor wage demands, the company\'s payroll system refers to statutory regulations and company regulations/policies. Employees can check this on their respective pay slips, instead of referring to a website that doesn\'t know who made it. The actions of the trade unions which use this as a reason for the strike are baseless.\n"In the previously circulated action circular, the things conveyed in the notification letter are untrue, unfounded, and tend to provoke and disturb company employees who intend to work seriously to support their families and to develop their abilities and competencies. as well as professionalism in work," he explained. (AT Network)\nEnvironmental Justice Atlas, 4/10/2022: "Residents that live close to Delong Nickel Smelter began to complain about the pollution from coal dust after the coal-fired power plants began operation [7]. These involve at least 6 villages:  Sama Subur, Wawoluri, Puuwonggia, Ranombopulu, Motui and Lambuluo. It was reported that the coal dust regularly blows up to 3 kilometers away from the power station and affects households both indoors and outdoors [7]. Children in the area began coughing and having respiratory problems [7].  A written complaint signed by 15 village heads was submitted to PT Obsidian Stainless Steel (OSS) [7]. Baharudin, Head of Motui Village, said the black dust was very disturbing to residents\' activities and that a lot of dust began to fly since the beginning of the previous August [7]. Roni Syukur, Head of Mining Engineering (KTT) of PT OSS, admitted that the black particles felt by residents were from coal and that the construction of the belt conveyor is in process to address the issue of coal dust from transportation [7].\nA number of violent protests by workers at the Delong industrial work took place towards the end of 2020, one of which paralyzed the operations of Delong\u2019s Virtue Dragon nickel smelter plant [8], [9]. A protest involved 800 workers calling for higher salaries and better working conditions e.g. permanent employment for contractors. When management refused to meet with the protestors, the demonstrators began destroying company property. Significant damage was inflicted up on the nickel production facilities, and about 40 pieces of heavy equipment were set on fire and destroyed[3], [4], [8]."\n\n(Ungku & Christina, 12/16/2020, reuters.com): "Violent protests by hundreds of workers at one of Indonesia\u2019s biggest nickel smelters on Sulawesi island operated by PT Virtue Dragon Nickel Industry (PT VDNI) had \u201cparalysed\u201d its activities, the China-backed company said in a statement.\nThe protest, which saw 800 workers calling for higher salaries and permanent employment for contractors, turned violent on Monday, as workers torched vehicles and buildings.\n\u201cThe rioting resulted in company activities being paralysed because the factory supporting equipment was badly damaged and about 40 heavy equipment and operational vehicles belonging to the company caught fire,\u201d PT VDNI, a unit of China\u2019s Jiangsu Delong Nickel Industry, said in a statement late on Tuesday." \n\nEnvironmental Impact:\nSmoke and coal dust from power plant resulting in respiratory problems, contaminated water hurting local fish supply, mud flooding during wet season, trash accumulation\n\n(Pulitzer Center, 1/23/2023, pulitzercenter.org): "... When Virtue Dragon Nickel Industry built the smelter there eight years ago, people from around Morosi went there hoping to make money. Economic opportunities grew when Obsidian Stainless Steel officially opened a nickel smelter last year. The two companies are subsidiaries of Xiangyu and the Delong Group, a Chinese business alliance. Obsidian has a production capacity of over 2.5 million tons of nickel per year. Virtue Dragon has a production capacity of over 1 million tons annually. Those two factories produce nickel pig iron (NPI), ferronickel, and nickel matte. Those three nickel ore products are components for making steel. As of the third quarter of 2021, Obsidian exported over 800,000 tons of NPI worth Rp24.5 trillion. Virtue Dragon exported 618,117 metric tons worth Rp17 trillion over that same period. In addition to stimulating the economy outside the factory gates, those two large smelters provide a lot of jobs. La Ode Muhammad Alihaswandy, Chief of the Office of Transmigration and Labor of Southeast Sulawesi, said that out of 25,281 workers at those two smelters, 1,893 are from China. \u201cThe mining sector accounts for 2.9 percent of workers,\u201d he said. According to Alihaswandy, the opening of shops is but one domino effect from the construction of nickel smelters in Morosi. Residents rent out boarding rooms or houses, open restaurants, workshops, and other commercial facilities. Newly built shops sprouted up along the road in Morosi... The growth in economy in Southeast Sulawesi due to this nickel mining activity has created a new problem: trash accumulation. In addition to the high amount of street dust and smoke resulting from the burning of coal to power the ore processing plant, trash scatters on the streets around the market or vendor shops, and is even found in the river and swamps. It appears that the local government has not made any plans in response to the impact of this sudden economic change. While most of the vendors come from outside of Morosi, locals tend to become factory workers or work side jobs in addition to their company jobs. Residents of Mandiodo, Tapuemea, and Tapunggaya villages no longer work as fishermen. They have gone to work in the factories or have taken up nickel mining. According to Ratna Kasim, head of neighborhood unit (RT) 4 in Tapunggaya village, of the 32 heads of households in her area only two still remain as fishermen. Her husband is paid Rp3 million a month as a security guard for heavy machinery located at the mining location. \u201cEverything has grown with nickel,\u201d she said, pointing to the houses with cars in the garages. Before the nickel mining, houses in her neighborhood had wood walls and sago palm frond roofing. Nearly no one can endure to work as fisherman in the villages located around the nickel mining location. Ratna said that the waters are contaminated with nickel slurry. Fishing platforms are often destroyed when barges in Tapunggaya Bay crash into them. As a result, fishers must search for daily catch further out at sea, making it more expensive to sail. \u201cIt is difficult to find fish now,\u201d she said. Amirudin is one of two heads of households in RT 4 in Tapunggaya who remains to be a fisherman. He confirmed Ratna\u2019s story. According to him, fish catches have been getting smaller since nickel mining started. Sometimes he catches 10 kilograms of fish a night, which are sold in the market for Rp200,000. \u201cBefore the nickel mining, my income was Rp600,000 a night,\u201d he said. This is also the case in Mandiodo village. Slamet Riadi, the local village head, said that of the 239 heads of households in his area, perhaps only about 10 percent are still fishermen. Slamet explained that in addition to having difficulty catching fish, working in the factory is more promising. \u201cIt used to be easy to catch fish and difficult to sell them. Now it is easy to sell them but you have to go far out to catch them,\u201d he said. In addition to earning wages working at the nickel smelter, residents in villages receive compensation from each company for the dust issue. In Mandiodo village, said Slamet, each family receives Rp1.5 million in compensation per month. This was an agreement reached between local communities and the company. According to him, the air became polluted after the nickel smelter went into operation, and conditions are particularly bad during the dry season. However, during the rainy season the dust dissipates but Mandiodo is inundated by mud, something which had never previously occurred in this village. In early December 2022, the entire Mandiodo village was inundated with mud mid-calf deep. According to Slamet, the mud ran down from the hills around Mandiodo that have become barren due to nickel mining. \u201cNickel gives life to the economy, but it destroys the environment,\u201d he said."\n\n(Environmental Justice Atlas, 4/10/2022, ejatlas.org/conflict): "Residents that live close to Delong Nickel Smelter began to complain about the pollution from coal dust after the coal-fired power plants began operation [7].

Workers from China were not allowed to leave the IMIP compound, had their passports withheld, and had difficulty communicating with those around them due to language barriers, the report said.\n\n(Environmental Justice Atlas, 7/5/2022, ejatlas.org): "Labor conditions is another major issue at the IMIP that has been voiced by multiple organizations. It is perceived by local workers that the Chinese peers tend to given higher wages and some of the Chinese workers were hired illegally, which led to anti-Chinese sentiments and even conflicts from time to time [32]. There were alleged labor malpractices such as termination of contracts, long working hours, unfair wages, and restrictions due to COVID-19, as well as high incident and fatality rate [7], [32], [33]. In a most recent case, \u201cleading activists of the United Labour and People\u2019s Alliance, which consists of three labor unions, the Morowali Industrial Workers Union (SPIM), the Morowali Indonesian Prosperous Labour Union (SBSI), and the Morowali Indonesian National Federation of Workers\u2019 Unions (FSPNI), were dismissed unilaterally on 14 August 2020 by the management of the company due to their union activity in the pandemic time [34].\u201d This incident started from a series of interactions between the Alliance and the company at the beginning of the Covid-19 pandemic, where 2,000 workers were sent home or told to quarantine. On 5 August 2020, the Alliance held a demonstration in front of the IMIP office, which led to a mediation meeting between the Alliance and the IMIP coordinated by the government through the Bahodopi sub-district secretary (Sekcam). On 14 August, three union leaders joined a meeting with the management of PT Indonesia Tsingshan Stainless Steel (ITSS) and PT Bukit Smelter Indonesia (BSI), which ended up with a unilateral dismissal of the three union leaders in the name of provoking colleagues to hold demonstrations and disrupting/hindering production. The layoff of union leaders later led to a strike of three days between 22 and 25 August 2020 [34]."\n\nRiot at a smelter run by PT Gunbuster Nickel Industry (GNI), in Indonesia Morowali Industrial Park, January 14, 2023\n(McBeth, 1/17/2023, asiatimes.com): "China\u2019s labor practices under hot fire in Indonesia"\nJAKARTA \u2013 A riot at a Central Sulawesi nickel processing complex, in which two people were killed and buildings and equipment destroyed, has raised questions over the management practices of Chinese companies and what procedures they follow to deal with labor disputes and other Indonesia-specific issues.\nSeventy Indonesian workers have been arrested following the January 14 violence at a smelter run by PT Gunbuster Nickel Industry (GNI), one of 18 companies now operating in the sprawling US$10 billion Indonesia Morawali Industrial Park (IMIP).\nHundreds of police were called in after union workers went on the rampage when talks over salary and safety concerns broke down and strike leaders allegedly became enraged after some of the workforce elected to stay on the job.\nIt is not clear how the two employees, a Chinese and Indonesian, died in the night of violence, but a 100-room dormitory, two dump trucks, a loader and other heavy equipment were destroyed..."\n\nDispute with local residents:\nLocal resident protests due to environmental concerns\n(Environmental Justice Atlas, 7/5/2022, ejatlas.org): "There were a number of protests and demonstrations held by local residents and student groups in response to the environmental and social concerns related to the IMIP and associated nickel mining activities. In 2019, there was a massive flood that hit the Bahodopi area. In September 2019, hundreds of residents took to the streets in Dampala Village in the Bahodopip district, about 7 kilometers away from the IMIP, as a result of the lack of satisfying response from mining companies after the flood that hit the three villages of Dampala, Le Le and Siumbatu on 8 June 2019 [28]. The flood disaster claimed the lives of two residents and hundreds of houses, as well as public facilities. Residents that are members of the Aliansi Rakyat Menggugat (Armet) claimed that the cause of the flood was related to the nickel mining activities upstream of the village, and demanded a review of the environmental impact assessment (Amdal) document of PT Bintang Delapan Mineral (BDM) and revoking the company of its mining business license (MBL) [21]. It was reported that the flood did not affect the operation of the IMIP, but cut off some workers from their workplace due to the collapse of bridges and road. The Morowali Police Chief ended up coordinating the negotiation between the protesters and the local government, who promised to compensate the local residents for their loss and evaluate the MBL holders such as BDM [18], [28]. In November and December 2021, demonstrations were held by student group Aliansi Mahasiswa dan Masyarakat Morowali (AMMM) and consumer group Aliansi Pelanggan Listrik Menggugat (Pelita) Morowali respectively to request for solving the local electricity crisis, as local residents suffered from frequent blackouts.[29] While the demonstration was more targeting the local government and electricity provider PLN, the electricity shortage at the local communities is in direct contrast with the scale of coal-fired power plants built by the IMIP that provides electricity supply to its industrial operations. In fact, the IMIP allocated most of its corporate social responsibility (CSR) budget to electricity subsidies to address the community electricity shortage in the Bahodopi district, including Fatufia, Keurea, Bahodopi and Bahomakmur villages [30]. It was reported that the construction of the CFPP at the IMIP helped with the electricity access in the area, especially with the subsidies from the company. However, PLN did not continue the collaboration with the IMIP and used diesel power instead [31]."\n\nEnvironmental Impact:\nDeforestation, water pollution, damage to local farms, respiratory infections\n(Environmental Justice Atlas, 7/5/2022, ejatlas.org/conflict ): "The Bahodopi district is home to 12 villages, including 4 villages most directly affected by the IMIP, namely Bahodopi, Keurea, Fatufia and Bahomakmur [9]. Local NGOs such as AEER, JATAM and Yayasan Tanah Merdeka (YTM) have been raising the issues regarding the environmental and social impact of the IMIP, including the nickel mining activities and the CFPPs [20]. An academic article also documented different forms of conflicts involving various stakeholders in the nickel mining area in and around the IMIP based on interviews and questionnaires, especially the conflicts between migrant communities and local residents, and between local residents and companies [9]. The often mentioned impacts include the degradation of forests, rivers and coastal zones in the neighborhood, the impact on local farmers\u2019 livelihood, and the health impact on the local residents [18]. It was reported that acute respiratory infection (ARI) is a common issue for local residents, including kids, in the Bahodopi district [18], [21]. While the companies claimed that they have used electrostatic precipitators at CFPPs and kilns to collect coal ash and some companies also used nets to filter coal ash, it appeared to be ineffective according to local residents\u2019 complaints [18].\n\nConcern over deep sea tailings disposal, plan ultimately withdrawn:\n(Reuters, 10/2/2020, www.reuters.com ): "Indonesia says battery-grade nickel project drops deep-sea waste plan"\nAn Indonesian nickel smelting project being built by China\u2019s Tsingshan Group and partner companies to produce battery-grade chemicals has withdrawn a request to dispose of waste in the ocean, a government official said on Friday.\nPT Hua Pioneer Indonesia, the company that requested the deep-sea tailing approval on behalf of the project had cancelled its request, Nani Hendiarti, an official at the Coordinating Ministry for Maritime Affairs and Investment, told Reuters.\n\u201cTheir main consideration was the complexity of the impact of sea tailing,\u201d said Nani, who is deputy of Environment and Forestry Coordination at the ministry. \u201cThey are now seeking other technological options.\u201d"',

                                    'Workers\' rights dispute:\nClashes have occured between Indonesian and Chinese workers, including in December 2022, which resulted in 3 deaths. As of January 2023, JATAM found that 10 workers have died at Gunbuster Nickel Industry\'s area at the industrial park since it started operations.\n\n(Jatam, 1/28/2023, jatam.org): The Arrogance of PT GNI and the Network of Vested Interests of the Political Elite behind the Clashes in North Morowali\n"The recent clashes between Chinese and Indonesian workers at the PT GNI smelter factory area were not only triggered by disagreement between Indonesian and foreign workers. The clash was the accumulation of a series of government policies and regulations trying to please the industry while ignoring a myriad of corporate crimes against workers, affected communities, and the environment.\nPT GNI is a Chinese company that started building a smelter and coal fired power plant in 2018 in Bunta in Central Sulawesi. The inauguration took place in Konawe in Southeast Sulawesi at an industrial park from the same owner, Tony Zhou Yuna, in presence of President Jokowi accompanied by a number of Ministers and Regional leaders on 27 December 2021.\nAt the inauguration, Jokowi emphasized that the local Governor and Regent should maintain \u2018a conducive investment climate, so that there would be absorption of labor, foreign exchange and taxes\u2019.\nThis includes keeping a strict law and order status in the area. It is not surprising that after the clashes at GNI, Jokowi\u2019s only immediately response was instructing the National Police Chief to take firm action against the rioters. In no time, the police arrested dozens of Indonesian workers who were accused of being the perpetrators, but all officials are turning a blind eye to the problems that caused the clashes.\nThis shows the true character of the government and the law enforcement model of the police: it is more important to protect investments, rather than the take care of the safety of the people, protect the environment, as well as the welfare of the workers themselves.\nPT GNI\u2019s Arrogance\nEven before PT Gunbuster Nickel Industry (PT GNI) was inaugurated by Jokowi, the operations of this \u00a0Chinese company had caused a number of environmental and humanitarian crimes. JATAM found that the company has a bad reputation when if comes to environmental and humanitarian crimes including its arrogance towards workers...\n[4] Based on information from a number of workers, 10 workers have died since PT GNI started its operations. The first victim, with the initials HR, died on June 3, 2020 after he got buried by an excavator. His body was only discovered two days after the incident.\nIn May and June 2022, 2 foreign workers committed suicide. \u00a0Their initials are MG and WR.\nThere were other heartbreaking stories. YSR was swept away by an avalanche while operating the bulldozer without lights and sank into the sea at a depth of 26 meters. AF lost his life while working in the smelter. He was found lifeless after falling next to the control board of a hydraulic machine.\nNS and MD are the two victims of a smelter furnace explosion on December 22, 2022. NS was a TikTok celebrity who went viral after he regularly posted his activities as a crane operator.\nOn January 14, 2023, the clash at PT GNI area resulted in 3 deaths; two Indonesian worker and a Chinese worker, and several injured.\n[5] Based on the statements of a number of workers, the company also cut various benefits that are workers\u2019 rights, as well as creating and maintaining wage gaps and worker facilities between Indonesian and non-Indonesian workers, even if they do the same type of work.\nFor example, Chinese workers are getting salaries and additional facilities that are higher than the majority of domestic workers. This gap is also reflected in the colour of the helmets: white and red helmets for Chinese workers, and yellow helmets for the Indonesian workers. The managers are wearing white helmets, the supervisors a red one, and the yellow helmet are for the \u2018crew\u2019.\nMost Chinese workers are in commanding positions and are giving orders to Indonesian workers. Few Chinese workers are speaking Indonesian, they give their instructions in Mandarin and are often not understood. This often frustrated Chinese workers, with start yelling which in their tun offends Indonesian workers. This unhealthy work atmosphere has not been dealt with for years...\nThe Network of Actors behind PT GNI\nTony Zhou Yuan, the director of PT GNI, also serves as director of two other nickel smelter companies in Southeast Sulawesi, namely PT Virtue Dragon Nickel Industry (VDNI) and PT Obsidian Stainless Steel (OSS).\nAccording to JATAM\u2019s records, PT VDNI reported and criminalized 12 workers who took action and clashed with company security officers.\nMeanwhile, PT OSS reportedly polluted the air in six villages with coal dust and polluted air from the company\u2019s coal power plants which are only hundreds of meters away from the residents\u2019 settlements. The residents\u2019 activities were disrupted, their eyes turned red when exposed to the pollution and often cough and have difficulty breathing.\nTony Zhou Yuan has a close relationship with Ali Mazi, the governor of Southeast Sulawesi. Ali Mazi is known to be on the supervisory board of Tony Zhou Yuan\u2019s Foundation, the Andrew & Tony Foundation.\nIn JATAM\u2019s view, the clashes between workers at PT GNI, the track record of the Chinese company, as well as the government\u2019s response and legal approach from the security forces are a concrete example of how the interests of business people and the ruling political elite in Indonesia are strengthening.\nJATAM believes that both the Indonesian and non-Indonesian workers are victims of this collusion. The government and security forces are actually framing a story in which they are scapegoating the Chinese staff, in order to avoid the unjust reality of a structural conflict."\n\nLand acquisition issues:\n(Project Multatuli,  05/07/2023, projectmultatuli.org/): "...Wahono has rice fields and oil palm plantations. Rice fields covering an area of \u200b\u200b1 ha, oil palm plantations covering an area of \u200b\u200b4 ha. Both are now no longer productive because the water never recedes.\nThe oil palm plantation is included in the PT GNI area. Apart from Wahono, there are around 37 ha of transmigrant land that is included in the industrial area. On average, residents have 2 ha of land. There are some who have 1 ha, there are also 6 ha.\nTheir land is now part of a "national vital object". Access for residents is difficult. The gates of PT GNI are closely guarded by security forces, from company security officers, police, to soldiers.\nResidents asked for compensation, including Wahono. However, PT GNI appreciates it with a land acquisition value of IDR 15 thousand/m\u00b2 or IDR 150 million/ha. In fact, in 2019, the release price was IDR 2,500/m\u00b2 or IDR 25 million/ha.\nWahono objected to the price.\nHe set the price of his land at IDR 50 thousand/m\u00b2 or IDR 500 million/ha, taking into account that PT GNI sunk his oil palm plantations. But, the company refused.\n\u201cBut, their tricks are good. They drowned [the palm trees]. "Finally, it became unproductive land," complained Wahono.\nWahono offered a middle way: asking PT GNI to help residents whose rice fields and gardens were sinking by converting them into ponds.\nPT GNI can lend tools and fuel to raise the embankments, providing a path for fish to descend to the empang. That way, said Wahono, society also has economic movement.\nHowever, the company ignored this proposal.\nWahono couldn\'t stay silent. Land as a source of livelihood for his family is a matter of life and death. And, as transmigrants, their land is limited.\nWahono tried to find another way. To get the company\'s attention, he closed the road in front of his house, the road used by PT GNI for motorized vehicles going in and out of the company.\nHowever, instead of listening to residents\' complaints, PT GNI sent security forces to their homes. Police and soldiers came and opened the way. Wahono couldn\'t move.\nFinally, Wahono took the initiative to make a new excavation so that the river could flow. After complaining to the regent\'s office, DPRD and local police, the government lobbied PT GNI to allow Wahono to borrow tools to dig.\nWahono worked on it for two months.\nAnd, it\'s proven. Since the excavation, the ground surface has become dry again.\nHowever, after only two weeks, the river route was closed again by PT GNI.\n"Because what I passed was a hauling road," said Wahono. "I want to build a bridge. If they run out of water, please close. If they are excessive, open them. So that we can live together. But, no. They just closed.\u201d\nWahono complained to the Governor of Central Sulawesi, Rusdy Mastura. Rusdy ordered his staff to go to the field.\nThe company\'s response was to raise the land surface of residential areas. The digging of a new river route was never granted. The house didn\'t sink anymore, but the puddle never disappeared.\nWahono\'s oil palm plantations and rice fields remain depleted."\n\nEnvironmental Impact:\nPT. GNI/PT. Stardust Estate Investment has damed the river near Bunta Village before it reaches the river, resulting in constant flooding and ruining cropland. Unfair land acquistion practices. Pollution from captive coal plants.\n\n(Benua, 9/2/2023, benua.id): "...the PT Stardust Estate Investment (SEI) industrial area in North Morowali, Central Sulawesi. In this industrial area there is PT Gunbuster Nickel Industri (GNI) with an area of \u200b\u200b1,907 hectares and PT Central Omega Resources (COR). Both are nickel refining smelter companies owned by Jiangsu Delong Nickel Industry Co.Ltd, investors from China which operate in Bunta Village, East Petasia District, North Morowali.\nTo move the smelter, GNI built a Captive Coal Steam Power Plant (PLTU) on a land area of \u200b\u200b712.80 hectares. Unfortunately, the process of building and working on the PLTU dammed the Lampi River at that location without the knowledge of residents and land owners around the river. Walhi Central Sulawesi predicts that when the intensity of rain is high, the Lampi River water will definitely overflow and could submerge rice fields and residential areas of local residents.\n"The air in hamlet 5 of Bunta Village is allegedly filled with sulfur dioxide gas (So2), which is a poisonous gas resulting from burning coal from the Captive Power Plant," said Sunardi Katili, Regional Executive Director of Walhi, Central Sulawesi during a press conference on Monday, June 12.\nNot only that, the construction of a jetty in Tanauge Village, Petasia District to serve as an entry point for the mobilization of coal supplies since early 2023, is alleged to have taken 65 hectares of residents\' land without any compensation process. Sunardi said that the majority of the people who work as fishermen at that location are also suffering due to the operation of the Captive PLTU.\n"The massive mobilization of coal-laden barges for the needs of the Captive PLTU at that location has had a big impact on the economic and social life of fishermen around that location. "In fact, some people have stopped fishing because coal often spills, plus strict security by the Air and Water Police has become a frightening threat for fishermen looking for fish again," explained Sunardi Katili.\nCurrently, PT. GNI has built 3 Captive coal PLTU units in Tanauge Village with a capacity of 300 MW which is only approximately 500 meters from residential areas. As a result, said Sunardi, residents around the PLTU have to clean their houses every day, close doors and windows to avoid black dust from PT\'s burning coal. GNI."\n\n(Project Multatuli,  05/07/2023, projectmultatuli.org/): "SINCE PT Gunbuster Nickel Industry (GNI) operated a smelter factory, Wahono and his family complained that the heat of the sun was no longer friendly. At the same time, the surface of the land around his house in Bunta Village, North Morowali, never dries out.\nThe plants lined up in front of the stilt house looked dry and covered in dust. The PT GNI industrial area is located about 10 km from his house. Dust from the factory flies around and sticks to the plants.\nUnder the house on stilts, black-brown water pooled and wet household utensils. The stagnant water smells and makes you itchy, said Wahono, who lives with his wife and three children, the youngest 6 months old, and his in-laws.\nPT GNI needs water as a coolant for coal power plants to meet the needs of nickel processing and refining facilities ( smelters ) in the area. The company takes water from the Koro Lamoito river\u2014residents usually call it the Lampi River\u2014by blocking the residents\' river flow. As a result, river water overflowed into residential areas and flooded roads.\nTo overcome this, Wahono raised the ground surface of the house and around the house with sand and stones. The plan is that he will build a boarding house on the land next to his house.\nWahono is a transmigrant from Ponorogo, East Java, whose parents brought him in when he was 17 years old in 1996. The New Order government provided 1 ha of land for the transmigrants to work on rice fields. In total, there were 132 families from Java who took part in the transmigration program. Wahono remembers that the army was closely monitoring the process of farmers planting rice fields.\nHowever, the Indonesian government also rolled out the red carpet for two corporations coming to North Morowali, which are slowly evicting the transmigrants\' land.\nThe first company was the palm oil plantation PT Agro Nusa Abadi (ANA), a subsidiary of PT Astra Agro Lestari Group, which arrived in 2006. Thirteen years later it was PT GNI.\n"Companies should come and bring goodness to the community," said Wahono.\nWhat happened was just the opposite. Companies come to steal people\'s land. The company also caused environmental changes, making it impossible for residents to grow crops, residents alleged.\nIn the past, Wahono rice fields used to harvest twice a year. After PT ANA arrived, this company was accused of embanking the rice field planting areas, causing flooding of rice fields and residential areas. Wahono can only harvest rice once a year during the dry season.\nThen, when PT GNI closed the river flow, the water overflowed even more. Both the dry season and the rainy season, the land is submerged. Wahono couldn\'t harvest at all.\nIt felt, for Wahono, like being pranked by the state. "I also know that [investment] is between countries," said Wahono, referring to PT GNI. \u201cBut we are the hosts. No matter how small we are.\u201d\n\'To and fro the water\'\nThe main road in Bunta Village is the route for PT GNI workers\' motorized vehicles and trucks entering and exiting the company. The road is now full of holes. Every time it rains heavily, the holes are flooded. Part of the ground surface of the house on the side of the road was also submerged in water.\nIn April 2023, floods submerged Bunta Village. The water almost touched the floor of the Wahono stilt house.\nIn 2019, shortly after PT GNI built a nickel smelter area, flooding also occurred. That year was the first time people\'s houses were flooded for three months. Land transportation was cut off. PT GNI workers, who go to work via the Bunta Village road, also have to use boats.\nIt is true that there is usually a flood every five years in Bunta Village. However, since PT GNI came to close the river, the impact of the flooding has become worse, residents said.\nThe flood never stopped completely. Even in summer, residential land remains flooded with water.\n"We can\'t stand it. "To and fro the water," said Wahono.\nWahono has rice fields and oil palm plantations. Rice fields covering an area of \u200b\u200b1 ha, oil palm plantations covering an area of \u200b\u200b4 ha. Both are now no longer productive because the water never recedes.\nThe oil palm plantation is included in the PT GNI area.

Stardust Estate Investment (SEI) and PT. Gun Buster Nickel Industry (GNI) in North Morowali Regency (Morut).\nChairman of the WALHI Regional Council for Central Sulawesi, Richard Labiro, said that we found facts and this has become a problematic issue in the community, especially Bunta Village, East Petasia District and Tanauge Village, Petasia District, North Morowali Regency (Morut)...\nHe said that the impact they found was that from an environmental perspective, the existence of a steam power plant (PLTU), residents of Hamlet 5, Bunta Village were exposed to Sulfur Dioxide (SO2) resulting from burning coal.\n"And in the early morning, residents there feel fog, but it\'s not the usual fog like before company activities," he said.\nAlthough he said, there has been no impact felt by local communities such as ISPA and others, but vulnerable groups who are threatened include mothers, the elderly and children.\nApart from that, he said, due to the company filling up the Lampi River, when it rains even a little, the Lampi River water overflows into the settlements, plantations, rice fields and livestock of the residents of V Transmigration Hamlet, Bunta Village.\n\u201cEven though the company is responsible for this. But it doesn\'t solve the problem. "The company excavated land in the area to fill in flooded roads," he explained.\nHe said, regarding the incident of water overflowing into residential areas and others, local residents had reported it to the Governor of Central Sulawesi, but until now there had been no solution.\nMeanwhile, the impact felt by Tanauge residents, he explained, was that compensation was not transparent and the payment was not open, there was no socialization of compensation prices to the community from the previous local government.\nApart from that, according to him, the agreement on the area for the construction of the Jetty between the company and the residents changed at the beginning when it was agreed that the area was 15 hectares, but as time went by it was suspected that the area would be more than 15 hectares.\n"So the water area has been privatized by the company to build a ring road," he said.\nEven for the activities of barges and towing barges for parking in front of residential areas, there is a price set by the company to be paid to the community, but the payment is not enjoyed by the residents, due to problems with the local village government.\n"On the other hand, the local community is worried that their availability of clean water will be affected due to the expansion of the company area," he said.\nBased on the results of the investigation carried out, he said, Walhi, as an organizer on labor issues, will strengthen residents affected by the company\'s activities. And will take legal action if there are indications of environmental violations."',

                                    'Dispute with local residents:\nLocal activists requested investigation into waste management practices of Kawasan Industri Makassar due to pollution in nearby rivers and tributaries and the strong smell of waste.\n\n(Kedai Berita, 5/20/23,kedai-berita.com): APH Asked to Investigate Corruption in Use of Waste Management Budget at KIMA\nA number of anti-corruption activist institutions in South Sulawesi are busy asking Law Enforcement Officials (APH) to investigate the smell of corruption in waste management budget activities in the Makassar Industrial Area (KIMA).\n"The problem of waste pollution in the riverbank areas there never stops and there is no solution. "Finally, the pond farming community on the banks of the Tallo River tributary, the Parangloe River, was once again affected, their fish died, allegedly because they were exposed to industrial waste from KIMA," said Chairman of the Sulawesi Anti-Corruption Committee Working Body (ACC Sulawesi) Kadir Wokanubun.\n"So I think it is very important that this case be investigated and brought into the realm of corruption, how exactly is waste management at KIMA, there will be a budget and it is very large, but how come there are still waste problems there which people around KIMA continue to complain about," Kadir added. \nHe believes that if the use of the waste management budget at KIMA goes according to its intended purpose and is right on target, then there will be no pollution to the surrounding environment caused by industrial waste. At least the level of environmental pollution from industrial waste can be minimized.\n"The question then is, why is the problem of environmental pollution in this area still occurring and is still occurring to this day. "This means that there is something wrong with the waste management there, and to what extent the supporting budget for this has been used, whether it has been maximized and according to its intended purpose, or are you sure it is on target," explained Kadir.\nHe also questioned the implementation of the vision and mission by PT KIMA, which has a mission for a quality green industrial area and a vision to become a smart, modern and green area management company with the largest output.\n"This is what PT KIMA must prioritize as the sole manager of the industrial area there. So basically all industrial companies in the area have tenant status. "They rent tenants or space provided by PT KIMA and of course with supporting facilities including waste management facilities," said Kadir.\nHe asked APH to investigate more deeply the SOP for waste management managed by PT KIMA, starting from the inspection process, supervision, capacity or condition of waste storage areas, which of course should change along with the increasing activity of companies renting tenants or premises in the area.\n"I think the focus should be here because it is related to the use of a very large budget which is related to the problem of environmental pollution due to the alleged impact of waste management which is still poor or not in accordance with existing regulations. "We are waiting for APH\'s seriousness in investigating this case," Kadir stressed.\nPreviously, in a Hearing Meeting (RDP) discussing the issue of environmental pollution of the Tallo River tributary, Parangloe River, Parangloe Village, Tamalanrea District, Makassar which was initiated by Commission C of the Makassar City DPRD, a number of important points were revealed.\nOne of them, it was revealed that a number of companies in KIMA had fulfilled their obligation to pay money every month to PT. KIMA as the sole operator in the industrial area is related to waste management.\nThe obligations paid by a number of companies to KIMA are said to vary in value. Some make monthly deposits of IDR 4 million to IDR 5 million, depending on the volume of waste generated from the company\'s activities in question.\n"Don\'t DLH or anyone else blame the companies at KIMA, don\'t say that PT at that time was like this and like this, the one responsible for the waste conditions at KIMA, not the businessman, he paid," said Chairman of Commission C of the Makassar City DPRD, Sangkala Saddiko while leading RDP discussed the issue of pollution of the Tallo River tributary, Parangloe River, Tamalanrea District, Makassar in the Makassar DPRD Banggar Room, Wednesday 17 May 2023.\n\u201cHow much does PT Wahyu pay? 4-5 million?. Well, he pays, so if waste like that occurs it is not the entrepreneur\'s responsibility, the responsibility is PT KIMA because this has been a long-standing problem. "So where has KIMA been responsible for the past few years?" Sangkala Saddiko said.\nHe admitted that he was surprised that the Makassar City Environmental Service (DLH), which was also present at the RDP, said that it had carried out inspections and so on. However, the problem of environmental pollution around KIMA is thought to be due to industrial waste still occurring.\n"If the inspection was carried out intensively then nothing like this would happen. "I admit that the environment is our partner. I always ask if he proposes regulations like that, but the question is why it still happens like that," said Sangkala Saddiko.\n"Remember, all the entrepreneurs there are making payments, don\'t accuse this PT, this PT is responsible for the waste, what is clear is that I asked Indofood, I asked Sari Roti and so on, it all comes down to KIMA, because he said PT KIMA oversees waste matters, so "That\'s not the responsibility of the entrepreneur, the responsibility is the manager, in this case PT KIMA," explained Sangkala Saddiko.\nHe said that he was elected from the Biringkanaya electoral district, Tamalanrea and knows exactly the problems experienced by the community regarding waste.\n"I once said to the residents, can you still stand a smell like this? "If it was in accordance with the existing progress, it wouldn\'t have happened like that. If, for example, it went like that, the entrepreneur at KIMA wanted to carry out his activities well, so he paid to comply with the existing regulations. I was sent proof of their payment," Sangkala Saddiko said again.\nHe also admitted that he was a regular road user in Kapasa Raya. That night he passed by and opened his car window. The stench approached.\n"That\'s why I asked from the Environmental Service earlier, if the waste mechanism was running, it wouldn\'t have happened like that and this, sir, I was a member of the DPRD for two terms and passed by there every day, last night, sir, when I opened the glass door, I came in with a bad smell. "It\'s not good, what DLH said earlier, according to the mechanism, it\'s like that," explained Sangkala Saddiko.\nThe PT KIMA representative who was present at the RDP explained that PT. KIMA has a number of companies under it and is bound by an agreement.\nWhen starting an agreement with the tenant, there is an attachment to the waste water quality standards required by the tenant.\n"We have that," answered the PT KIMA representative in the RDP.\n"Then related to how it is managed, from us it is 24 hour operational when it comes to temperature, PH, CO and DO every week, so we analyze all the required parameters according to the company every week a month," explained the PT KIMA representative.\nHe also explained that since 2022, PT KIMA has been required by the Ministry of the Environment to provide tools called sparing and sparing tools. And this tool has been installed at PT KIMA\'s waste water outlet to monitor the environment directly.\n"That is an obligation that we have carried out," said the PT KIMA representative.\nRegarding environmental performance, he admitted that he had held PROPER since 2004. Where PT KIMA achieved blue PROPER. These are the environmental performances that the party will probably carry out at this time.\n"Then regarding why the waste water that reaches the Tallo River tributary is black, actually if you look at our environmental documents, our documents were actually written from the start. "Our responsibility extends to the water bodies before the Tallo River tributaries," explained the PT KIMA representative.\n"However, looking at the current fact that along the canal created by KIMA, the community and all entrepreneurs outside KIMA have connected it, so in 2018 at the Ministry of the Environment we revised the document, the ministry issued that it could no longer be charged by PT KIMA related responsibility along the canal," continued the PT KIMA representative.\n"Why, because along the canal there are many connections from terminals, from markets and all MSME businesses, entrepreneurs and all kinds of things are all there. "So the responsibility for environmental control is transferred to us, so we can only reach the beach point at the Sector Police," added the PT KIMA representative.\nHe admitted that the problem now is because everything is connected. In the past, he continued, when the wall was still intact and then it was broken into by the Head of the Daya Village, he also asked a Makasaar City Government official who at that time was known as Manai Sofyan.\n"I asked why the wall was broken into, it would be polluted by the community, he said where else would the community\'s water go if it didn\'t come this way. "So that\'s the reason, I still remember that time I went down to the field and we saw that our channels were already connected," emphasized the PT KIMA representative.\nTallo River Tributary Pollution Complaint\nThe Makassar City Environmental Service (DLH) discovered several facts about alleged environmental pollution that occurred in the Parangloe River, a tributary of the Tallo River, Parangloe Village, Tamalanrea District.\nFirst, there was foam in the Parangloe River, then there were dead fish and shrimp in residents\' ponds which were approximately 50 meters from the river location in question.\nThe facts found in the field were based on documentary evidence in the form of videos and photos reported by a resident of Bontoa village, Parangloe Village, Tamalanrea District regarding the presence of foam on the surface of water bodies that spread across the Parangloe River.\n"Now after discovering this fact, the team carried out a cross-check in the field with the aim of identifying and collecting data as material for further analysis," said Acting Head of DLH Makassar City, Ferdi, Monday 15 May 2023.\nThen Ferdi revealed that reports of water pollution in the Parangloe River, which he admitted was thought to be the result of industrial activities, had been discovered the previous year by the monitoring team.\n"So this data and verification will be a complement or support for follow-up material," he explained.\nThen there are several companies that operate from downstream points to the West Ring Road along the Parangloe River, namely PT. KTC, PT MT, PT BFM, PT FKS MA.tbk, PT CPI (RPHU).\n"There are still several other companies that have not been identified," he explained.\nHowever, based on the results of interviews with people around the location, information was obtained that there were five residential drainage channels that flowed down to the Parangloe River.\n"This has not been identified because the weather at that time was rainy," he said.\nMeanwhile, the location of the drainage channel for the residents of Bontoa Village is the Komunai Waste Water Disposal Installation (IPAL) which was built by the Makassar City Public Works Department in 2019.\n"According to the local RW, the IPAL is no longer used because there is a blockage in the channel so that residents\' septic tank waste water automatically flows into the drainage and then into the river," he said.\nNot only that, some of the houses of Bontoa Village residents cross the banks of the Parangloe River, so it is estimated that domestic wastewater is directly discharged into the river.\n"There is a narrowing of the width of the Parangloe river at coordinates 5\u00b0 5\'47.93\u2033S\n119\u00b028\'21.60"E so that the river water does not flow smoothly and there is a buildup of sediment which causes a smell and black water," he explained.\nHowever, based on the results of field parameter tests, it was revealed that the Parangloe River is a tributary of the Tallo River which is located in two sub-districts, namely Tamalanrea and Biringkanaya.\nThe activities along the Parangloe River are residential, industrial and pond activities. So these activities affect the carrying capacity and water quality of the Parangloe River.\nIt could even be fatal if the population increases and industrial activities along the Parangloe River affect the environmental conditions of the Parangloe River.\n"Domestic wastewater discharge originating from residential areas and industry that is not managed properly will cause sedimentation and river water quality. "This can be seen physically in the condition of the Parangloe River water," he explained.\nApart from residents\' domestic wastewater, industrial and pond activities also contribute to the water quality of the Parangloe River. Moreover, industries that do not treat their wastewater properly will cause public unrest.\nFerdi explained that the appearance of floating or foamy foam could also be concluded from natural factors, namely the natural cycle of rain falling from the sky or the discharge of waste water all at once.\n"To find out this, integrated monitoring is carried out involving environmental monitoring functions," he added.

The land for Padung Industrial Park was originally set aside in 1995 for PT Andalas Rekasindo, a company established by the West Sumatra Provincial Government and other parties, and the West Sumatra provincial government held a 55% stake composition. Eventually, a joint venture was made with a company from Johor, Malaysia, which resulted in the formation of PT. Padang Industrial Park. "Regional Secretary of West Sumatra, Hansastri, said that previously the provision of capital to PT. ARP is stated in West Sumatra Regional Regulation No. 5 of 1995 concerning regional capital participation in third parties as founders in the formation of PT ARP.  The West Sumatra Provincial Government plans to revise the regional regulation, but this cannot be done because there is an investigation into allegations of budget irregularities from PT. ARP. However, currently the High Prosecutor\'s Office has issued an Investigation Termination Warrant (SP3). "If later the assets are legally clear, we will continue the plan to revise West Sumatra Regional Regulation No. 5/1995," he said."',

For centuries, the O Hongana Manyawa tribe, one of these last indigenous groups, have roamed the forests of Indonesia\'s remote Halmahera island in small family bands tied closely to rivers in the island\u2019s interior.\nBut today Kumbang\u2019s family and their indigenous culture face an existential threat\u2014one fueled by an industry widely touted for its green credentials, and often heralded as a panacea to the growing climate crisis. \nWhere there was once vast rainforest, today an expanding massive nickel mining venture is clearing the homeland of O Hongana Manyawa, as suppliers in Indonesia race to fulfill a growing global demand for batteries powering the electric vehicle industry.\nKumbang no longer lives with his family in the rainforest, but he fears for their future as he watches the rainforest shrink around them. Their staple foods of carb-rich sago palm fruits have been razed and rivers providing drinking water poisoned by mining run-off; the rattan fibers used for clothing have become harder to find, while resin-producing trees, the sap from which is used for torches, have been obliterated. Mining encampments filled with thousands of men and security forces now occupy the hunting grounds where O Hongana Manyawa once chased deer and wild pigs for food.\n\u201cThe forest is everything, it is their heart and life,\u201d said Kumbang. The young man\u2019s name has been changed to protect his identity due to what NGOs and activists say are credible threats to his safety for speaking out about the issue. \u201cMy parents and siblings are in the forest and without support they will die.\u201d\nEnvironmental groups and indigenous rights activists have sounded the alarm in recent days. They allege that mining company Weda Bay Nickel and other similar projects are destroying the traditional lands of the O Hongana Manyawa, also known as the Forest Tobelo, and are at risk of devastating their forest-dependent way of life. \nThe mining projects form part of Indonesia\u2019s emerging electric vehicle battery supply chain, into which major electric vehicle firm Tesla has reportedly invested $5 billion so far, while partnering with several companies connected to Weda Bay in the past year. \nIn the last few months, two leading French and German firms have also announced they\u2019re on the verge of pouring billions more into electric vehicle battery production sourced from Weda Bay Nickel, touting its compliance with the \u201chighest international environmental, social and governance standards.\u201d This includes the Initiative for Responsible Mining Assurance standards, which requires Free, Prior and Informed Consent (FPIC) from indigenous peoples affected by the project.\nBut rather than securing the consent of O Hongana Manyawa, Weda Bay Nickel has ravaged their lands and livelihoods, Kumbang and indigenous activist groups say.\n\u201cI will never give consent for the company to use our lands,\u201d Kumbang said.\nHongana Manyawa number around 3,000 people across Halmahera, the largest island in eastern Indonesia\u2019s Northern Maluku province. Many of them, like Kumbang, who is now a Christian, were born in the forest and later adopted via missionary-led interventions or resettled through government policies to integrate O Hongana Manyawa into Indonesian society in recent decades. Many still retain ties to the forest and Kumbang says he visits his parents regularly.\nBetween 300 and 500 members of O Hongana Manyawa, like Kumbang\u2019s family and relatives, are still considered \u201cuncontacted" because they remain in voluntary isolation in the forests of Halmahera, says Sophie Grig, senior researcher for the indigenous rights nonprofit Survival International. The unsettled members of the tribe hunt and tend to bamboo gardens throughout the forest, limiting their interactions with outsiders.\n\u201cThey rely on the forest for everything that enables them to live and survive and thrive,\u201d Grig told VICE World News. Without the forest, \u201cthey won\u2019t be able to sustain themselves.\u201d\nYet the outside world is forcing itself upon O Hongana Manyawa.\nWeda Bay Nickel\u2019s approximately 45,000 hectare concession was awarded in 1998 by Indonesia\u2019s then military dictator Suharto. After Weda Bay Nickel\u2019s operations stalled for several years due to a nickel market downturn, the project resumed with renewed intensity after Chinese conglomerate Tsingshan Holding Group came on board with a controlling stake through a subsidiary in 2017. As the mining has reached further into the forests of Halmahera, riverways have been filled in with ore to form roads penetrating into the tribe\u2019s territory, cutting off O Hongana Manyawa from drinking water, says Kumbang, who still regularly travels into the forest to visit his family. \nEven when the government later expanded forest protections in 1999, Weda Bay\u2019s concession was carved out by presidential decree in 2004 to allow for tens of thousands of hectares of deforestation from open pit mining. Weda Bay Nickel has since contributed to the more than 47,000 hectares of the estimated 724,000 hectares of natural forest in Central and Eastern Halmahera cleared between 2017 and 2021, according to data from Forest Watch Indonesia and local environmental journalist Christ Belseran. Much more is expected in the coming years as the nickel mining projects expand to meet global demand.\nAnnas Rasyid, an activist with the Indonesian Indigenous People\u2019s Alliance (AMAN), says that O Hongana Manyawa\u2019s sustainable way of life is under threat from decades-long government policies to \u201ccivilize\u201d them, forcing families to live in sweltering and cramped tin roofed permanent homes. Some nomadic O Hongana Manyawa have become dependent on company handouts like instant noodles and rice, while members of the tribe have also become scapegoats for authorities\u2014tortured and imprisoned for crimes they likely did not commit and cleared off their land as a result, he added. \nWhen the government grants a mining concession there is never consultation with local people, because authorities do not consider them as owners of the land under Indonesian law, Rasyid says. \n"In their perspective, the land belongs to the government,\u201d he explained, adding that Indonesian lawmakers, many with financial links to companies using indigenous lands, have refused to pass legislation that would provide stronger legal rights for indigenous peoples.\nIndonesia is the world\u2019s leading nickel producer, and has welcomed foreign investment by courting manufacturers like Tesla to grow its electric vehicle battery production. However, the industry\u2019s development ignores any meaningful recognition of indigenous peoples, says Novenia Ambeua. She\u2019s Chair of the activist group North Maluku Region Indigenous Peoples Alliance of the Archipelago, and a member of the Tobelo, a coastal indigenous group with close connections to O Hongana Manyawa, whose community\u2019s territory has also been impacted by Weda Bay Nickel.\n\u201cThese are the forests which we guard for the future generation and now they are being destroyed for electric cars, where is the heart of people in the west?\u201d Ambeua told VICE World News. \u201cThis is making everything worse.\u201d\nIndonesia is the world\u2019s leading nickel producer, and has welcomed foreign investment by courting manufacturers like Tesla to grow its electric vehicle battery production.

Despite clear evidence that suppliers like Tsingshan were carrying out destructive actions against indigenous peoples and local communities, this didn\u2019t stop Tesla from signing deals with them, the report highlights.\n"Tesla must know that the electric vehicle battery supply chain has negative social impacts on Indonesian citizens,\u201d JATAM director Melky Nahar told VICE World News. \u201cSo if Tesla buys nickel from companies in Central Halmahera, indirectly Tesla is involved in these impacts.\u201d\nFurther foreign investment into the area\u2019s electric vehicle battery industry has just been finalized and more is expected in the coming months. Australian firm Thiess announced last month an $87 million ore-hauling contract for Weda Bay Nickel, declaring it looked forward to \u201cbuilding strong relationships with the local community.\u201d In January, Bloomberg reported that German chemical giant BASF is also finalizing a multi-billion dollar deal with Weda Bay Nickel\u2019s Eramet to develop a smelter for nickel coming from the tribe\'s forest lands. BASF told VICE World News that it \u201chas not yet decided whether such a project will be implemented.\u201d Activists say this project would also directly threaten the lives of O Hongana Manyawa and their neighbors. \nSurvival International and other indigenous rights groups say that despite claims that these projects are in compliance with international standards, nickel produced by Weda Bay is in violation of widely recognized UN and World Bank requirements for FPIC agreements from indigenous peoples.\nWeda Bay previously received $207 million in World Bank guarantees for its investment, legally requiring FPIC, though a World Bank audit following a complaint dismissed these concerns in 2011 and urged the company to continue dialogue with affected communities. Many of the surrounding coastal indigenous communities ultimately signed agreements under pressure and threat from police and local authorities, accepting extremely low prices for their lands. But O Hongana Manyawa living in the forests never agreed to cede their lands to the company, Kumbang says. \nWeda Bay Nickel knows that its mining concession overlaps with the territory of nomadic, isolated groups from O Hongana Manyawa who reject mining on their lands, according to an internal company report obtained by VICE World News. \nThe 2013 report, funded by Weda Bay Nickel and prepared by the U.S.-based firm Cross-Cultural Consulting Services, found evidence of multiple groups of O Hongana Manyawa living inside the mining concession. The consulting firm verified the report\u2019s existence but told VICE World News it no longer works with Weda Bay Nickel. \nO Hongana Manyawa \u201cdo not like to interact with outsiders\u201d and it would be \u201cunethical\u201d to seek to contact them, the report notes. \u201cThe critical issue\u2026 is how to apply FPIC when a good proportion of the indigenous population does not want to be contacted.\u201d\nGiven that the company has been mining since 2019, any claims of securing \u201cprior\u201d consent are a charade, Grig points out.\n\u201cThey cannot possibly have had free, prior and informed consent because these people are uncontacted,\u201d Grig said. \u201cHow could you possibly get FPIC from an uncontacted tribe?\u201d\nTesla\u2019s indigenous rights policy requires free and informed consent from its suppliers.\nTesla, Weda Bay, and all other companies named did not respond to repeated requests for comment from VICE World News. Survival International has called on Tesla to publicly commit to not sourcing nickel from any suppliers mining on O Hongana Manyawa\u2019s lands. \nWeda Bay says it will respect indigenous ways of life, but the mine\u2019s destruction has already violated the site of Kumbang\u2019s own birth, he says, where his umbilical cord is buried beneath an ngofa ngoe sapling. In O Hongana Manyawa language, the name means \u201ctree with many children,\u201d and its growth was supposed to symbolize Kumbang\u2019s own future family. \nBut the last time Kumbang returned to the area in September, his birth grove had been bulldozed to muddy, red earth for Weda Bay\u2019s mining operations.\n\u201cIt broke my heart,\u201d Kumbang said. \u201cEverything in the forest is getting destroyed now\u2014the river, the animals, it is all gone.\u201d"\n\n(Mongabay, 3/8/23, mongabay.co.id): Stories of Tobelo Indigenous Women Fighting When Damaged Forest Turns into a Mine\n""-The Tobelo Dalam indigenous women and those living in coastal villages protested the destruction of the customary forest to make way for a nickel mine and various supporting facilities. Like last October, indigenous people, including women, blocked heavy equipment operations.\n-Novenia Ambeua,  an indigenous woman of Tobelo descent on the South Wasile coast , said that for the Tobelo people, the forest is home and sacred . If the forest is damaged, everything in it will also be damaged. Forests provide everything, from food such as hunting, medicine to sources of livelihood, including looking for resin.  Indigenous people\'s gardens are also in the forest.\n-The community rejects PT IWIP\'s expansion into Akejira Mein\'s  ( Aruku Ma Ngairi ) Indigenous Forest . They also demanded that the company stop paying compensation or compassion to other parties suspected of acting on behalf of the land owner.  \n-Achmad Zakih , Secretary of the North Maluku Forestry Service, dismissed the threat of forests in Central Halmahera. However, he said that it is necessary to strengthen the existence of indigenous peoples who have lived and lived in the forest for generations through a stipulation through regional regulations.""\nWhile recognizing that it was unethical, the report nevertheless made preparations for how to gradually approach and gain consent of groups which remained in voluntary isolation. \n\u201cIt came down to the fact that this [mining project] was going to happen,\u201d Chris Duncan, the lead researcher hired by Weda Bay to produce its 2013 report and an anthropologist who has been studying O Hongana Manyawa since the 1990s, told VICE World News. Duncan said the logic was: \u201cLet\'s try to make it better, as opposed to just opposing it. In the end we failed\u2014we didn\'t get FPIC, which was the goal.\u201d \n\u201cThese people [O Hongana Manyawa] have been screwed for decades and they will continue to get screwed,\u201d he said.\nThe company has \u201cgood relations\u201d with O Hongana Manyawa and identified 22 of the tribe\u2019s cultural heritage sites inside its concession while implementing FPIC principles, an IWIP representative said in a 2019 statement, citing the same 2013 plan which had \u201cfailed\u201d according to its lead researcher. \nThe day after VICE World News emailed Eramet CEO Christel Bories, the company posted two statements on its website. Eramet said it had launched a \u201ccurrently ongoing\u201d study in 2023 with a local anthropologist to research the impact of the mine and \u201censure we understand and respect the way of life\u201d of O Hongana Manyawa.\n\u201cIn the event that indigenous peoples may be affected by our activities, further dialogue is required, leading to the consent of these communities to the company\'s operations,\u201d Eramet said in another statement posted on April 7, adding the company committed to being \u201caudited\u201d to show compliance with international standards.\nThe company also said there are no O Hongana Manyawa in coastal areas and that its planned project with BASF would not directly impact them. But O Hongana Manyawa do not live on the coast, they live in the interior forest, and the smelter would source nickel from that area, indigenous activist groups say.\nEramet did not respond directly to VICE World News\u2019 requests for comment.\nKumbang said he has been approached multiple times in the past few years by Weda Bay Nickel and its hired anthropologist to retroactively gain consent for mining operations on his relatives\u2019 land. Kumbang repeatedly refused. The anthropologist did not respond to requests for comment from VICE World News. \n\n(Environmental Justice Atlas, 1/31/2023, ejatlas.org): ""The IWIP and the associated nickel mining and processing activities have significant impacts on the environment, biodiversity, and the indigenous communities in the area [8]\u2013[10]. Back in 2010, Indonesian community and advocacy groups JATAM (Mining Advocacy Network), WALHI, KIARA, and KAU formed an international coalition to oppose the project and the World Bank\u2019s support of WBN [11]. The groups filed a complaint with the Compliance Advisor Ombudsman (CAO) of the World Bank [11]. Earlier studies indicated that there were significant barriers to access meaningful redress for communities that are remote in the area [2].\nOver the years, the Indonesian government has been trying to resettle the indigenous group in the region outside the forest and force them to adopt conventional settled lifestyles instead of their traditional nomadic lifestyle. These people, called the O Hongana Manyawa (also referred to as Tobelo Dalam, which allegedly was against the wishes of the people themselves [11]) and means \u201cforest people\u201d in their indigenous language. They are one of the five last remaining nomadic Indigenous Peoples in Indonesia and categorized as endangered [3], [12] according to Aliansi Masyarakat Adat Nusantara (Indigenous Peoples Alliance of the Archipelago, AMAN), the main representative organization for Indonesia\u2019s indigenous peoples. According to an interview with Tupa, one of the members of the six remaining tribes that are still practicing the traditional nomadic lifestyle in the forest, \u201cTrees are gone and replaced with the big road, where giant machines go in and out making noise and driving the animals away\u201d [3]. For the few last remaining tribe members in the forest, the forest is not only a place to inhabitat and find sources of food, it is \u201calso a home and \u2018the bridge\u2019 that connects them with the spiritual world\u201d [3]. It was also reported that a local resident of Lelilef Sawai Village indicated that she and other mothers were prohibited from fishing in Tanjung Uli, Karkar, and Cacu and from taking firewood [9]. The reclamation of nickel ore storage areas by PT IWIP in the Karkar area also affected local fishing activities that used to take place in the same area [9].\nAccording to the fieldwork and report of Indonesian NGO AEER, the villagers of Lelilef Sawai, Lelilef Waibulan, and Gemaf complained about respiratory problems due to air pollution from the captive coal-fired power plants that use low calorie coal with a calorie content of only 4,200 kcal/kg [9]. Local residents also had restricted access to clean water, with the 3km Ake Sake River dammed and diverted for the construction of one of the IWIP smelters and other rivers such as Seslewe Sini and Kobe polluted [9]. AEER indicated that the increase of logging and the damming and diversion of the Ake Sake River has led to deforestation and reduced water absorption capacity and contributed to the flood that took place in August 2020 which inundated the villages and roads, including the IWIP area [9].\nDuring the inaugural ceremony of the IWIP project in 2018, IWIP claimed that they had obtained community consent and that Akejira nomads, which Tupa belongs to, had agreed to the nickel mining activity in Central Halmahera [3]. This was questioned by Munadi Kilkoda, the regional chief of AMAN Malut (North Maluku) [13]. Some local residents had no other choice but to sell land to the company and the bid price from the companies was  low (e.g. IDR 8,000-9,000 per sq metre, equal to around half a euro) based on regional regulations [9]. While the majority of residents have sold their land, a few have refused to do so. It was reported that \u201cintimidation by security forces, and dispossession of access to forest and other social and environmental concerns have sparked protest and denunciations of the projects\u201d [11]. Some protests took place in 2019 by the relatives of O Hongana Manyawa band that live in Akejira forest [3]. Another protest took place in July 2020, when 450 South Wasile residents walked for two days to Kao Rahai, where PT WBN was opening a new nickel mining area, and blockaded roads by building tents and halting mining activities [9].\nIn addition, there were protests from students and civil society organizations in Ternate. AMAN urged IWIP to 1) comply with international laws and treaties including ILO Convention 169 and the UN Declaration on the rights of the indigenous peoples; 2) implement free, prior, informed consent (FPIC) on all forms of policies before operations that affect the livelihood of indigenous peoples; and 3) comply with Indonesian law, especially the Constitutional Court Decision Number 35/PUU-X/2012 regarding customary forests (not state forests) [3]. Students protested in Ternate and in Tobelo, North Halmahera, including the Student Action Solidarity for the Indonesian People (Samurai) Malut and the Sylfa Student Association of Kharun University [5], [14], [15]. The latter held a protest with the theme \u201cSave Ake Jira, the Heart of Halmahera and the Tobelo Dalam Tribe\u201d. The students demanded that the Halteng Regency Government ratify a local regulation on indigenous peoples in order to protect this tribe [5],[3]. IWIP representative responded [16] that they had obtained a borrow-to-use forest area permit (IPPKH) and that the Tobelo Dalam community is one of the main stakeholders in their mining concession, with whom they had developed a good relationship [5]. On the other hand, the issue of Ake Jira\u2019s customary forest reached the Presidential Secretariat Office (KSP) in Jakarta with a letter sent by AMAN Malut that complained about the issues faced by the indigenous people of Tobelo Dalam in Central Halmahera after the arrival of WBN and IWIP in the area [16]. KSP issued a letter that urged the companies to respect and protect the indigenous people of Tobelo Dalam and align with the recommendations put forward by AMAN [16].\nOn 23 October 2019, another demonstration was held by Aliansi Masyarakat Ake Jira Halmahera (the Ake Jira Halmahera Community Alliance, AMARAH) in front of the Ternate Mayor\u2019s office [17]. The crowd carried banners reading "" Selamatkan Ake Jira\u201d (\u201cSave Ake Jira\u201d) and asked for the revocation of the Mining Business Permit (IUP) of IWIP, WBN and PT Tekindo Energy [17]. The AMARAH alliance is a coalition of NGOs, civic organizations, movements, and student associations, including Walhi Malut, AMAN Malut, LBH Marimoi, Daurmala, FNKSD, Sekolah Critis, GeMPAR, SAMURAI, LMND, GAMHAS, The Buas, PANDECTA, KAMMI IAIN, Jendela Mahasiswa Politik, Pusmat, Gemah IAIN, Jejak Timur, SEMUT, DEMA Ekonomi IAIN, and Gerilya Institut [17]. A representative of the demonstrators indicated that the mining activities in the Ake Jira forest not only threatens the Tobelo Dalam, but also has an impact on the waterbody in the region [17]. It was also indicated that the residents of Tobelo Dalam that lived in Ake Jira had left their original residential area due to massive mining activities, while AMARAH representative did not know where they had left for at the moment [14], [17]."""\n\n(Environmental Justice Atlas, 1/31/2023, ejatlas.org): "According to the fieldwork and report of Indonesian NGO AEER, the villagers of Lelilef Sawai, Lelilef Waibulan, and Gemaf complained about respiratory problems due to air pollution from the captive coal-fired power plants that use low calorie coal with a calorie content of only 4,200 kcal/kg [9].

Muhlis said that the company that carries out mining activities in North Kao District, North Halmahera, pays various residents\' land.\n"From the results of our investigation, some cost Rp. 3,500 to Rp. 10,000 per meter. This is of course important to reconsider, because the price is too low, \u201che said.\nHe added that the people\'s land is land for farming. This means that people\'s livelihood from agricultural produce does not match the price set by PT EFI. Moreover, the family life of the farming residents is very dependent on the land.\n"Therefore, the paradigm that must be built in carrying out land acquisition for residents is not to compensate for land losses, but to compensate for profits," said Muhlis.\nThe local government, Muhlis emphasized again, must be really clear about this. Do not issue policies that actually harm society. Moreover, in the momentum of land acquisition for residents, many parties want to make a profit.\n"We want to emphasize to all parties, not to seek profit from the suffering of the people," concluded Muhlis."\n\n(Harian Halmaheral, 8/27/2020, https://harianhalmahera.com/halut/pt-emerald-digugat-pengrusakan-lahan/): "Merice Dino, a reisdent in North kao District, North Halmahera, sued PT EFI for destroying residents\' land.

One of them is in the case of land in North Halmahera Regency, North Maluku.\nThe land case in North Halmahera involved the assistant supreme judge, Preastio Nugroho. Where, he allegedly received IDR 725 million from the Chairman of the Tobelo District Court (PN), I Gusti Ngurah Putu Rama Wijaya.\n"(Prasetio Nugroho) received IDR 725 million." That\'s what the Corruption Eradication Commission (KPK) charges, as quoted by detikcom, kalesang.id, Friday (19/5/2023).\nThe handover of money worth IDR 725 million was received by Preastio Nugroho at Rest Area KM 19 of the Jakarta-Cikampek Toll Road, South Tambun District, Bekasi Regency on February 18 2022.\nThe money came from PT Emerald Ferochromium Industry (PT.EFI) as respondent I, in civil cassation case Number 542 K/Pdt/2022 regarding the dispute between applicant Marjon Ahiki and the mining company PT Emerald Ferochromium Industry which currently operates in Kao District , North Halmahra\nThe IDR 725 million, as the prosecutor said, was then received by 3 people, including Prasetio Nugroho, IDR 85 million, Supreme Court staff Redhy Novariasza IDR 60 million, and the remainder was received by Supreme Court PNA Muhajir Habibie.\nIn a copy of the cassation file quoted by detikcom, the dispute was initially heard at the Tobelo District Court, North Halmahera. Where, Marjon Ahiki fought PT. EFI, North Halmahera Regency Government and Pricing Team.\nMarjon Ahiki asked the Supreme Court to decide that the price determination by the Forkopimda Pricing Team of the North Halmahera Regency Government must be canceled by law.\nThen, stating the results of land measurements by PT company officers. EFI is legally flawed and must be canceled by law.\nMarjon asked for compensation for the price of land per meter in Gulo Village worth IDR 150 thousand/meter. Then, on November 24 2021, the Tobelo District Court did not accept Marjon Ahiki\'s application.\nThis is the reason why Marjon Ahiki filed an appeal to have his lawsuit granted. As a result, the Supreme Court also rejected Marjon Ahiki\'s appeal on February 21 2022.\nAfter investigating, 3 days before the decision there was a flow of funds from the Chairman of the Tobelo District Court. Even so, the Corruption Eradication Commission (KPK) in its indictment did not say whether the funds reached the cassation panel.

The Wilmar Group Dumai Pelintung is currently submitting another 2,000 hectares to the central government, but has not yet received approval.\nHead of the Dumai City Investment and One Stop Service (DPM-PTSP) Office, H Zulkarnain, through the Head of the Licensing Division at the DPM-PTSP of Dumai City, Ghafar, confirmed that PT Wina had not yet obtained a permit.\n"We have never issued a building permit (IMB), a location permit," said Ghafar, Thursday (29/7/2021).\n"The company yesterday came to the office to take care of permits, but was hampered by land issues," added Ghafar.\nHe explained that KID has about 400 hectares of land for industry, while PT Wina stands on 400 hectares outside.\nAs previously reported, besides not having a permit, the company is currently experiencing a work accident that occurred last Friday (16/7/2021).\nAs a result of work accidents, two lives were lost, the company was suspected of not complying with regulations regarding Occupational Safety and Health (K3).

The village head and local environmental service carried out mediation and temporarily stopped PT Focon from operating.\n\n(Joglo Jateng, 7/13/2023, joglojateng.com): Polemic of Black Smoke from the Candi Semarang Industrial Area\n"A number of residents of Pratama Green Resistence, Kedungpane Village, Mijen District complained about air pollution originating from the Candi Industrial Area (KIC). Several residents admitted that they felt short of breath due to exposure to smoke from PT industrial waste. Focon.\nOne of the residents of RT 06 RW 05 Kedungpane housing Pratama Green Residence, Bambang explained that he is one of the residents who is very vulnerable to air pollution in his home area. He is now experiencing breathing problems and has to go to hospital for treatment.\n"I had to go back and forth to the hospital for treatment because I had breathing problems. I think air pollution will kill people slowly. "Moreover, dust flies into the kitchen of the house," he said when confirmed by Joglo Central Java, recently.\nTherefore, another resident of Pratama Green Residence Housing, Nur Hanif asked the factory PT. Focon to stop production. Then limit the distance between the factory location and residential areas.\n\u201cHave to move. The minimum rule for setting up a factory to a residential area is 2 kilometers. "It\'s only 2 meters," he complained.\nMeanwhile, the Head of Kedungpane Village, Tri Sari Utami, confirmed that residents had previously reported air pollution. The majority of residents complain of frequent shortness of breath.\n"Several complaints such as air pollution, vibration noise, strong odors and scattered dust were felt by residents. "We have also carried out mediation with the Semarang City Environmental Service (DLH) and we have recorded the complaints," he continued.\nSome time ago, a meeting was also held between local residents and PT. Focon. However, the results of the meeting were considered nil.\n"There have been meetings but there has been no solution," he said.\nResponding to this, the Head of the Semarang City Environmental Service (DLH), FX Bambang Suranggono, said that currently the government is making efforts to resolve the issue between Kedungpane residents and PT Focon. Apart from that, his party has also carried out direct mediation and verification in the field.\n"We have followed up. Currently in progress. "So we ask that we be able to fulfill our obligations within 30 days," he said.\nDuring the fulfillment process, said Bambang, his party also prohibited PT Focon from operating temporarily. This decision was also approved by both parties\n"The mediation was attended by residents of Green Residence Housing, PT Focon, and KIC area managers. Apart from that, PT Focon is currently making improvements to the operational equipment that resulted in the air police. "After making improvements, the city and provincial governments will carry out an assessment which will take the next mechanism steps," he concluded."',

The Balang institute also found that 37 ground wells had dried up since PT Huadi Nickel-Alloy Indonesia began operating in 2018.\n\nDispute with local residents:\n(IDN Times, 3/24/2022, Sulsel.idntimes.com): Residents Protest the Impact of Bantaeng Industrial Estate Activities\n"Hundreds of residents of Pa\'jukukang District, Bantaeng Regency, South Sulawesi, feel they are victims of the impact of the activities of companies operating in the Bantaeng Industrial Area (KIBA).\n1. The company operates in residential areas\nArdi said KIBA is located in the coastal area of \u200b\u200bPa\'jukukang District, Bantaeng. The land area of \u200b\u200bthis national strategic project reaches 3,151 hectares."To support the company\'s activities, an export port and a 101 hectare wind power plant will be built in the Pa\'jukukang waters," said Ardi.vPT Huadi is the first smelter factory to be inaugurated in Bantaeng in January 2019 at KIBA. According to the local community, the company is said to have exported 15 times, starting from November 2018.vThere are three companies operating at KIBA. Namely, PT Huadi, Yatai and Wozhou. The company\'s operations are right next to the settlements of coastal residents in Papanloe Village. The seven hamlets in the village are directly affected by the activities of companies that produce materials for nickel raw materials.vThe coastal area of \u200b\u200bPa\'jukukang is said to be designated as KIBA because it is considered dry and the land is unproductive. Even though most of the people there work as fishermen, seaweed farmers, the red stone manufacturing industry, and there are also rice fields. "Especially in Papanloe Village, there are still 160 seaweed farmers, 114 of whom depend on the seaweed business," Ardi explained his data.\n2. The company\'s activities destroy the source of income for residents\nArdi said the activity of material transport ships disrupted farmers\' seaweed cultivation. Seaweed locations that meet directly with ports and ship lanes are often damaged by being hit by ships. As a result, the location of the stretch of seaweed is damaged and unable to continue cultivation. Not only disrupting seaweed cultivation, the activities of material transport vessels also disrupt fishermen\'s fishing grounds. Of the seven hamlets in Papanloe Village, Mawang Hamlet is the hamlet that feels the most impact from the company\'s activities. The common impact that occurs is pollution. "Such as smell, dust and noise," said Ardi. Dust, sourced from several company activities. Such as dust from material transport vehicles that use village roads as well as public access roads used by residents. Another source of dust, comes from drying the ore to the burning process through the furnace. The combustion process is also a source of dust as well as emits a pungent odor. "To describe the smell, residents call it the smell of scorched canvas. The noise for 24 hours comes from heavy equipment activity in the company area, material transport car activities, and sounds in the form of bangs," said Ardi. Not to mention the problem of drought. In September 2021, the residents\' wells in the Balla Tinggia hamlet, Kayu Loe and Mawang hamlet, Papanloe Village dried up. The drought is thought to have been caused by the drilled wells built in the three companies\' areas. As a result of the identification, there were 18 residents\' wells that had dried up. Even though the well is used for the daily needs of local residents. "Before it dries up, the residents use the well for bathing and washing, as well as meeting the water needs for making or for the production of red stone," said the resident of Papanloe Village.\n3. Companies at KIBA are considered disobeying and ignoring the rules\nFurthermore, Ardi explained, from the start of socialization by the government, companies at KIBA would prioritize recruiting local workers. The goal is that the people living around KIBA can improve their standard of living. But in practice, the company is considered to be in denial. Instead, they recruit more workers from outside. "The company has not prioritized Papanloe residents in recruiting employees. Of the total number of employees as of October 2021, there were 1,255 people, while there were only 220 employees from Papanloe Village," said Ardi. Ardi added, residents have also taken various ways to submit their demands to the company. Starting from the village government to the local DPRD. "But the problem really is with the company. Because it works without looking at the EIA, so there are a lot of impacts," he added. Confirmed separately, Community Development (Condev) PT. Huadi Nickel Alloy Indonesia Andi Rezky Darmawan Latippa said that his party had mediated the issue of residents\' demands. "We have received approximately 13 representatives from the community. The employee recruitment issue has been explained directly by our HRD manager," Rezky said in a written statement. Rezky said the environmental problems that residents complained about had also been explained to the local community. "Our party has made several improvement efforts accompanied by the Ministry of Environment and Forestry and the Provincial Environmental Management Service in managing the environment based on applicable rules and laws," he said."\n\nEnvironmental Impact:\nShip movement has hurt seaweed cultivation; dust and waste pollution, water shortage due to company activities.\n\n(IDN Times, 3/24/2022, Sulsel.idntimes.com): Residents Protest the Impact of Bantaeng Industrial Estate Activities\n"Hundreds of residents of Pa\'jukukang District, Bantaeng Regency, South Sulawesi, feel they are victims of the impact of the activities of companies operating in the Bantaeng Industrial Area (KIBA)...\n2.

Some people living in the area told The AP their land was seized or they were facing pressure from PT KIPI and local officials to move, and offered unfair prices. PT KIPI did not respond to a request for comment. Residents hope the project may bring jobs, but worry they will lose their traditional livelihoods as fishermen, farmers and increasingly, eco-tourism hosts as dust and ash smother their fields. An analysis by CELIOS of PT KIPI\u2019s environmental impact assessment forecasts the the problems will worsen once the project begins operating.\n\u201cThe effects of hot water waste contamination, coal-fired power plant fly ash, rising air temperatures, project smoke, noise, sea dredging, and spilt coal/fuel spills will cause the sea to become murky, which will cause tourism (industry) to decrease and the quality and quantity of (fish) catches to significantly decrease,\u201d it said."\n\nEnvironmental Impact:\n (Adaro, 5/16/2023, adaro.com)\nEnvironmental groups in Indonesia and abroad have raised concerns and staged protests over the proposed building of new captive coal power plants for the industrial park. In Phase 1 and Phase 2 of KIPI\u2019s development, Adaro plans to build approximately 1000 MW capacity of coal power plants in each phase, before the anticipated hydroelectric power plants are ready to operate. In February 2023, it was reported that Adaro was having trouble finding financing for the development of their coal power plants, as many international banks that Adaro had previously borrowed from had pledged to stop supporting new coal projects (ft.com, 2/6/2023). Environmental groups also called out Hyundai, who plans to use aluminum from the smelter for electric vehicle production, for violating its own carbon neutrality principles. At Adaro\u2019s 2023 annual shareholders\u2019 meeting in May, two of its own shareholders protested against the planned captive power plants (news.mongabay.com, 6/15/2023). Mongabay also reported that it is unlikely the captive coal plants will be shut down in 2030, once hydropower is available, as the master plan for KIPI designates a zone of the park that is permitted to use power from coal power plants (news.mongabay.com, 6/15/2023). In May 2023, Adaro had only secured funding from domestic Indonesian banks for the first phase of the coal power plant development (1,060 MW capacity).\n\n(AP News, 9/14/2023,apnews.com/): New Indonesian industrial park on Borneo, feted as \u2018green,\u2019 will be powered by coal, report says\n"...The environmental impact assessment commissioned by PT Kalimantan Industrial Park Indonesia, which operates a large part of the current development, describes what is happening in the 15,000 hectare (32,100 acre) area, where plumes of dust mushroom into the sky along the Celebes Sea as heavy equipment fells trees and razes paddy fields.\nIt says the project\u2019s coastal zone is a conservation and migration area for green turtles, hawksbill turtles and killer whales. Hawksbill turtles are listed as critically endangered by the International Union for Conservation of Nature, while green turtles are considered endangered.\nHis wooden boat rocking as excavators and construction trucks roar nearby, fisherman Erwin laments the constant ship traffic delivering supplies to the remote area.\n\'We are looking for fish further and further away from the beach because there are lots of ships in the area driving fish away,\' said Erwin, who like many Indonesians uses only one name. \'If (the industrial park) is built, I don\u2019t know what the future holds but it\u2019s clear that it will definitely have an impact (and) hurt my income.\'"\n\n(Mongabay, 6/15/2023, new.mongabay.com): Indonesian coal giant Adaro\u2019s \u2018sustainable\u2019 smelter slammed as \u2018greenwashing\u2019\n"Indonesia\u2019s largest coal miner, PT Adaro Energy, faces claims of greenwashing over its plan to build coal-fired power plants on the island of Borneo to provide electricity for its aluminum smelter there.\nAt its annual shareholders\u2019 meeting in Jakarta on May 11, two shareholders protested against the planned captive power plants, known as such because they\u2019re designed specifically to supply certain industries and not to feed into the grid.\n\u201cStop the development of new coal plants. One billion people will be threatened by the climate crisis due to coal plants,\u201d one of the shareholders shouted while being escorted out of the meeting.\nThe plants, with a combined capacity of 2.2 gigawatts, will supply Adaro\u2019s aluminum smelter in an industrial park, itself branded as \u201cgreen,\u201d in North Kalimantan province. The park is being touted, once completed, as the largest of its kind in the world, home to Indonesia\u2019s first electric vehicle battery production, alongside petrochemical and aluminum industries.\nThe smelter project, estimated to cost $2 billion, has entered the preconstruction phase and is expected to start commercial operation in 2025. Once running at full capacity in 2029, it will be able to produce 1.5 million metric tons of aluminum a year, the company says.\nAluminum is used in the lithium nickel-cobalt-aluminum oxide (NCA) cathodes that are the most widely cathodes currently found in EV batteries. Because of this, and the adjacent EV battery plant in the industrial park, Adaro is marketing the aluminum smelter project as a flagship green and renewable development for Indonesia.\n\u201cSeeing the future development of electric vehicle (EV), the Company is ready to participate in providing aluminium for the EV\u2019s material and support green economy for sustainable living,\u201d Adaro said in a filing to the Jakarta stock exchange.\nBut building the smelter will start with building the coal-fired power plants to run them. Only later, in 2030, will the smelter switch to using power from a hydroelectric plant.\nAdaro said that while the main power source for the industrial park will be renewables, coal will still be needed in the initial stages of the smelter as it takes longer to build renewable power plants.\nBinbin Mariana, Southeast Asia energy finance campaigner at climate group Market Forces, noted that state-owned aluminum producer PT Indonesia Asahan Aluminium (Inalum) is also building a smelter in North Sumatra province \u2014 powered by two hydro plants.\n\u201cBy using hydropower plants, the cost of the aluminium production is much cheaper compared to using coal-fired power plants,\u201d she said. \u201cThe cost if using hydropower is less than 5 U.S. cents per kilowatt-hour, compared to 6 to 8 U.S. cents if using coal.\u201d\nAnd even after Adaro makes the switch in 2030, it\u2019s not clear whether the captive coal plants will be decommissioned, according to the Center of Economic and Law Studies (CELIOS), a Jakarta-based research institute.\n\u201cIs there any guarantee that when the hydropower plant is ready, the captive coal plants will be shut down? No,\u201d CELIOS executive director Bhima Yudhistira said.\nHe added that\u2019s because the master plan for the \u201cgreen\u201d industrial park explicitly allows coal power: the estate\u2019s environmental impact assessment maps out two zones, green and blue, with factories and smelters in the blue zone permitted to use power from coal plants.\nEven using the best available technology to minimize emissions, the captive plants will still emit an estimated 5.2 million metric tons of greenhouse gases per year, according to Market Forces.\nGreenpeace Indonesia energy campaigner Bondan Andriyanu said this goes against the Indonesian government\u2019s pledge to phase out coal and switch to renewables in a bid to mitigate climate change. The planned coal plants will also dash any hope of meeting the wider goal to limit global temperature rise to 1.5\u00b0 Celsius (2.7\u00b0 Fahrenheit) above pre-industrial levels.\nThe International Energy Agency says there can be no new coal-fired power plants after 2021 if the world is to stay within this threshold, agreed on by nations including Indonesia in the Paris climate pact to avoid the most catastrophic impacts of climate change.\n\u201cThe development of a new coal plant will only exacerbate the impact of the climate crisis, pollute the environment, harm the people and Indonesia\u2019s commitment in reducing carbon emissions from the energy sector,\u201d Bondan said.\nLess money for coal\nNabilla Gunawan, Indonesia campaigner for Market Forces, called the smelter project \u201cgreenwashing\u201d since it\u2019s being marketed as sustainable. With other environmental groups also pointing this out, Adaro has reportedly struggled to raise money from international banks to finance the project.\nThe company had planned to get $1.1 billion in bank loans to help meet the $2 billion price tag, but several global banks that had previously done business with Adaro now say they won\u2019t finance the smelter. This includes Singapore\u2019s DBS and OCBC, and the U.K.\u2019s Standard Chartered.\nFor coal companies like Adaro, it\u2019s becoming increasingly difficult to get funding as a growing number of banks and investment funds announce their commitments to tackling climate change by no longer funding industries that contribute to greenhouse gas emissions, according to Binbin of Market Forces.\nMany of these institutions are part of the U.N.\u2019s Net-Zero Banking Alliance, accounting for about 40% of global banking assets. To date, 115 banks in 41 countries have joined the alliance.\nThat leaves a shrinking pool of banks willing to fund coal, especially for companies like Adaro, which not only plans to build new power plants, but also still has plans to prospect for new coal reserves, Binbin said.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s funny is that if you look at Adaro\u2019s annual report in 2021, it says that they\u2019re still exploring new mines,\u201d she said.\nAdaro\u2019s coal production hit a record high in 2022, amounting to 62.8 million metric tons, a 19% increase from the 52.7 million tons it mined in 2021, casting further doubt on the company\u2019s commitment to transition away from coal.\nAdaro Minerals, the subsidiary in charge of the smelter project, has denied that the company is struggling to get funding for the project.\n\u201cThe rumor is not true,\u201d Adaro Minerals director Wito Krisnahadi said as quoted by CNBC Indonesia, adding that they\u2019ve been able to secure financing from at least five banks.\nWito declined to name the banks.\nAdaro Energy\u2019s head of corporate communications, Febriati Nadira, said separately that the company is in the process of finalizing the deal to finance the project.\nAdaro Minerals has also denied allegations of greenwashing. President director Christian Ariano Rachmat said the company remains committed to transitioning toward green energy, but will need time to build the hydropower plant to meet the aluminum smelter\u2019s demand for electricity.\nChristian also said that three-quarters of aluminum smelters around the world still use coal, hence Adaro\u2019s case wasn\u2019t an outlier.\n\u201cOne day, we want to produce green aluminium, but it needs time to get there, at least until our hydro [plant] is finished,\u201d he said.\nHyundai driving into controversy\nBesides Adaro, critics have also gone after South Korean automobile giant Hyundai, which signed an agreement in November 2022 to buy aluminum from Adaro for its EV production. Hyundai described the aluminum as \u201cgreen and low-carbon\u201d because it would be produced using hydroelectric power, and thus would \u201caccelerate\u201d the transition to sustainable energy and help the company meet its net-zero emissions goal by 2045.\nBut the agreement fails to mention that hydropower will only come into the mix at a later stage, with the smelter initially relying on burning coal. That makes any purchase of aluminum from Adaro\u2019s smelters a violation of Hyundai\u2019s Carbon Neutrality Principles, Binbin said.\nThose principles require Hyundai to cut not just its own emissions, but also those emissions associated with assets it doesn\u2019t own \u2014 like the aluminum it plans to buy from Adaro. These are known as Scope 3 emissions, and in 2022 Hyundai reported 18.3 million metric tons of Scope 3 emissions from its supply chain, up from 17 million metric tons in 2021.\n\u201cThis means that this 18 million tons of emissions have to be reduced,\u201d Binbin said. \u201cBut if Hyundai buys aluminium from Adaro, the emissions [from its supply chain] will increase. So this doesn\u2019t make any sense.\u201d\nUPDATE: On 12 May 2023, the deal to finance the smelter project reached financial closing. A group of five Indonesian domestic banks \u2013 Mandiri Bank, Bank Negara Indonesia (BNI), Bank Central Asia (BCA), Bank Rakyat Indonesia (BRI), Permata Bank \u2013 provided a total of 2.5 trillion rupiah (US$166.8 million) and US$1.5 billion loans to Adaro\u2019s smelter and coal power plant subsidiaries, Kalimantan Aluminium Industry (KAI), and Kaltara Power Indonesia (KPI)."\n\n(Petrominer, 3/14/2023, Petrominer.com): Signed MoU with Adaro, Questioned Hyundai\'s Climate Commitment\n"A coalition of environmental organizations from Indonesia and South Korea has raised concerns over the memorandum of understanding (MoU) signed by Hyundai Motor Company and PT Adaro Minerals Indonesia Tbk. The reason is that, based on the MoU, Hyundai can buy a maximum of 100,000 tons of aluminum per year from Adaro. Meanwhile, Adaro plans to build a new 1.1 GW coal-fired power plant as an energy source to produce aluminum.\nResponding to this problem, 10 environmental organizations from Indonesia and Korea have sent an objection letter to Hyundai on January 24, 2023. They also expressed their concerns over the cooperation plan, but until now Hyundai has not responded.\n"We have expressed our concerns and sent a letter to Hyundai in January, but until now Hyundai has not updated our letter," said Campaigner from Market Forces, Nabilla Gunawan, Monday (13/3).\nAccording to Nabilla, this partnership with Adaro is in direct conflict with Hyundai\'s climate commitments. The reason is that Hyundai failed to take into account the consequences of building a new coal-fired power plant on the climate and environment.\n"Hyundai has reneged on its commitment to environmentally friendly vehicles by using aluminum produced using a new coal-fired power plant," he said.\nEven though Adaro labels this aluminum smelter project as an \'environmentally friendly\' project, the initial phase of the smelter will use electricity from a new coal fired power plant. In fact, the average PLTU in the world operates for 46 years, meaning that it will be difficult for Hyundai to achieve the carbon neutral target in 2045 if Hyundai still relies on aluminum produced from Adaro\'s coal energy.\n"Electric vehicle consumers are increasingly skeptical that the goal of the energy transition is still littered with the massive use of coal," said Bhima Yudhistira from the Center of Economic and Law Studies (CELIOS).\nOn the previous occasion, the National Coordinator of the Mining Advocacy Network (JATAM), Melky Nahar, said that Indonesia does not need new coal-fired power plants which clearly pollute and damage the environment. Companies like Adaro have a history of destroying people\'s lives and have contributed to environmental disasters such as floods and landslides in Kalimantan.\u201d\n\u201cWe were very concerned about Hyundai signing a memorandum of understanding to purchase aluminum produced by Adaro, when it became clear that the production would be supported by a new coal-fired power plant. Hyundai should not support dirty aluminum production by Adaro and encourage low-carbon investment in Indonesia," said Melky.\nCurrently, Adaro\'s aluminum smelter is known to have a planned capacity of 1.5 million tons per year in 2029. Adaro plans to rely on coal-fired power plants in the early stages, then add capacity from hydropower in the final stage."',

                                    'Environmental Impact:\n\n(Batam Today, 3/8/2023,batamtoday.com/berita ): DLHK and ESDM Riau Islands Call PT BAI\'s Cut and Fill in Galang Batang Not Violating the Rules\n"The cut and fill activity carried out by PT Bintan Alumina Indonesia (BAI) on one of the hills in Galang Batang, Gunung Kijang District, Bintan Regency, had become a public concern.\nMoreover, cut and fill activities which are considered by many parties to have an impact on environmental damage, continue to be of public concern, especially environmentalists.\nHowever, regarding the cut and fill carried out by PT BAI, the Head of Forestry Management and Forest Product Utilization of the Riau Islands DLHK, Bherly Andia, said that the area being cut and filled was no longer a limited production forest (HPT) area, but already APL.\n"PT BAI\'s cut and fill land on the Galang Batang hill is already an APL bleaching area (another use area). Previously it was an HPT area, but a partial release has been made from HPT to HPK (convertible production forest), and finally it became an APL area. "explained Bherly Andia when met in his office, Tuesday (7/3/2023).\nMeanwhile, the Riau Islands ESDM Service explained that regarding the cut and fill carried out by PT BAI in Galang Batang, there was no permit yet. However, if the cut and lill location is included in the Galang Batang Bintan Special Economic Zone (KEK), no permit is required.\nHe added, for now in Galang Batang there is only 1 mining permit, namely PT. Graha Mandala Bintan (GNB). However, the company is still in the exploration stage, not yet in production operations.\nBut for PT BAI, because the cut and fill location is included in the KEK Galang Batang area, a permit is no longer needed as long as the excavated products are used for themselves and not for sale," said Head of Technical and Environmental Mining Engineering at the ESDM Kepri Office, Reza Muzzamil Jufri.\nThe main director of PT BAI Santoni, who confirmed via cellular, said that his party would not work arbitrarily without a permit. Especially those that come into contact with the environment, said Santoni, his party is very careful.\n"Is it possible for a project of this size to play haphazardly without a permit. In terms of the HPT forest area land issue that was alleged to have been damaged by PT BAI, that is not true because we have made an application to the Ministry of Forestry. That the cut and fill area being carried out by PT BAI is currently has left the HPT area to become APL," he concluded."',

The community submitted a report document containing traces of environmental and humanitarian crimes from NCKL company\u2019s operations in Kawasi, Obi Island, South Halmahera, North Maluku Province.\nThe Harita Group subsidiary is projected to gain an increase in net worth from USD 1.1 billion to USD 4.6 billion. This action was carried out to convey to brokers, as public intermediaries in buying and selling shares related to the dangers of investing in NCKL.\nPT Trimegah Bangun Persada Tbk (NCKL) is a subsidiary of Harita Group that operates the first High Pressure Acid Leaching (HPAL) smelter on Obi Island, North Maluku. The company produces 60,000 tons of nickel per year. HPAL technology will convert local low-grade ore into mixed hydroxide deposits, a form of nickel that can further be processed to make batteries.\nIn its operations, PT Trimegah Bagun Persada, along with PT Gane Sentosa Permai, PT Halmahera Persada Lygend, PT Megah Surya Pertiwi, and PT Halmahera Jaya Feronickel on Obi Island, all companies under the auspices of Harita Group, have devastated the land / plantation land of residents, polluted water sources, river water, and sea water, polluted the air due to dust and pollution that has an impact on the health of residents, to trigger social conflicts due to intimidation and repeated violence against residents who defend their living spaces. PT Trimegah Bangun Persada and\u00a0 a number of other companies owned by Harita Group also unilaterally annexed residents\u2019 land without fair negotiation and compensation.\n\u201cLili Mangundap and four other families who owned land in Kawasi village were annexed by the company. The company and the South Halmahera Regency government also plan to relocate Kawasi residents to Eco Village Housing, located 5 kilometers to the south of Kawasi. For residents, this relocation not only removes them from their homes, but also robs them of their cultural and historical values. Not only that, residents are also excluded from their sources of life such as land, fields, and the sea,\u201d said Muhammad Jamil, Head of the Legal Division of JATAM Nasional.\nHarita Group\u2019s mining operations resulted in polluted water sources of Kawasi residents and sedimentation of nickel ore from the company\u2019s operations. Before the mine came in and operated, residents could get water for free, but now they have to spend money to get clean water. This condition makes it more difficult for residents who are economically deprived because they are forced to use polluted water sources. PT Trimegah Bangun Persada and other Harita Group-owned companies in the region dump waste into rivers and flow into the sea. This causes the coast and sea to turn cloudy-brownish. The marine ecosystem on Obi Island is damaged by sewage pipes leading to the sea. The fish that have been consumed by residents are also contaminated with heavy metals.\nIn addition to pollution in the sea, the company\u2019s activities are so close to settlements, that residents are forced to deal with dust, noise, and a dirty environment. During the dry season, kitchen utensils, dining tables, chairs, floors, and even in the room are full of dust from company activities and coal dust. Based on information from residents and officials at Kawasi health clinic, acute respiratory infections (ARI) are the most important health problem in Kawasi. Most patients are toddlers. There were 124 infants aged 0-1 years who visited the health clinic from January to December 2021. Toddlers aged 1-5 years were recorded as many as 283, followed by the age group of 20-44 years as many as 179 people.\nIn addition to bringing health problems, Harita Group\u2019s operations also ignore the OHS Compliance aspect of its workers. Throughout 2022, the mining and mineral processing sector dominated accidents in North Maluku, especially belonging to Harita Group. Based on media reports, in the 2019-2023 time frames, 8 cases were recorded with 2 victims died and 5 people were injured. This fact refutes Harita Group\u2019s claim that there were no casualties due to work accidents. In nickel mining operations, Harita Group, through PT Halmahera Persada Lygend (HPL), also uses coal-fired power plants for operations. The total capacity of the coal-fired power plant is 210 MW. PT HPL is a joint venture between Harita Group and Ningbo Lygend from China which has around 2,030 MW of coal-fired power plants in the process of construction and pre-permitting. The company also targets a total of 4,200 MW of coal-fired power plants on Obi Island.

This project was invested with Ningbo Lygend Resources Technology and Indonesia Harita Group.\nThe coal-fired power plant project with a capacity of 4\u00d7380 MW is build to support the laterite nickel ore smelter project which is also located on Obi Island. The first phase of the project includes the construction and installation of the system. The target is that the CPP is claimed to supply energy sources for the development of nickel smelters as raw materials for the battery industry...This project also has a negative impact on the people living around the project area. Lily Mangundap, as in her interview in Project Multatuli, said that this nickel smelter industry project had slowly \u201ckilled\u201d her and her family. The company PT Trimegah Bangun Persada, a subsidiary of the Indonesia Harita Group, forcibly evicted its plantation land to expand its concession by building a nickel smelter. The land that was Lily\u2019s source of livelihood disappeared and turned into the Obi Island Industrial Estate, which produces nickel ore as the raw material for batteries for electric vehicles."\n\n(Mongabay, 11/14/2021, mongabay.co.id,): " Obi Island, in South Halmahera, North Maluku, has built a nickel downstream industrial area and built a factory for the production of electric vehicle battery raw materials.

It\u2019s been quiet on this island for most of his life. Without a private jet, getting to Obira from the Indonesian capital, Jakarta, is at least a two-day journey involving an overnight ferry and hours of driving on roads stippled with potholes.\nLiyus, who goes by one name, said he used to drink from the rivers that run past his village, but since the nickel mine added its acid-leaching refinery two years ago, the waterways have turned dark red, so thick with pollution at some points that rows of coconut trees have been killed off. He doesn\u2019t know what\u2019s in the water, only that it bleeds into the sea and that his nephews have had to go farther and farther out to find fish. He pointed to a fishing net drying on a nearby tree. It was stained a reddish brown.\nIn an hour-long interview, representatives from the two companies that jointly own the processing plant on Obira island \u2014 an Indonesian firm, Harita Group, and a Chinese firm, Lygend Resources \u2014 said that the operation has not had a negative impact on the environment and that the pollution along the coast was not related to waste produced by their plant. All of their operations, they emphasized, are in \u201cfull compliance\u201d with government requirements. \u201cWe looked at what was the best and we confirmed it with the government,\u201d said Tonny Gultom, Harita\u2019s head of health, safety and environment...\nThe nickel mine on Obira has been operated by Harita since 2016, but in 2018, Lygend joined to plan, design and construct the HPAL refinery, eventually acquiring a majority stake in the project. The processing facility, which was designated a priority for the national government, opened in 2021.\nAfter the companies withdrew their initial plan to dump the HPAL waste into the sea, they told authorities that they would store the waste on land, drying out the acidic slurry before dumping it back into the mining pit, and then treating the residue water in a tailings \u201cpond.\u201d\nOnly a year earlier, however, Harita executives had published a research article in a science journal stating that land disposal on Obira is actually \u201cless suitable\u201d because the region is in a notoriously active seismic zone \u2014 as recently as 2019, a 7.2-magnitude earthquake devastated a port town on Bacan island, less than 50 miles from Obira \u2014 and is frequently visited by heavy rainfall. That article also noted that about 7,000 villagers lived downstream from the site, concluding that the construction and water control required for land disposal was \u201cnot feasible.\u201d\nAsked about those findings, a Harita spokesman acknowledged that storing the waste on land is dangerous but said the company is managing the risks by drying out the slurry and dumping it back into the mining pit, where it is prevented from seeping into local waterways.\nBut a foreign mining consultant who has been working on projects in Indonesia for more than two decades said: \u201cIt\u2019s a massive heap of waste. And if it\u2019s not stored properly, you can have landslides. That\u2019s my biggest concern.\u201d He spoke on the condition of anonymity because of business considerations...\nFour international mining experts independently reviewed photos of the mining site at Obira taken by The Washington Post. The experts said that it was impossible without a formal audit to ascertain whether Harita and Lygend were dumping HPAL tailings into the sea, but that there were multiple signs that the companies were generally failing to contain mining waste.\nThe photos show \u201cdevastating\u201d levels of deforestation, which can increase the risks of tailings accidents, said Aimee Boulanger, executive director of the Initiative for Responsible Mining Assurance, an organization that audits mining operations and measures them against social and environmental standards. Even if tailings were not being actively pumped into the sea, there don\u2019t appear to be \u201cany significant controls\u201d over what\u2019s flowing out of the mine and entering waterways, she added.\nSam Riggall, an advocate of responsible mining and the chief executive of Sunrise Energy Metals, an Australian nickel and cobalt mining company, said the material entering the rivers around the mining facility resembled processed waste, rather than just runoff from open-pit mines...\nGultom, Harita\u2019s head of safety, acknowledged that the HPAL refinery was producing a \u201chuge volume\u201d of waste that could pose safety risks if not properly managed, but he stressed that it was being handled with adequate precautions.\nThe discolored water near Obira\u2019s coast, he said, was caused by sedimentation created by timber mining years ago. \u201cIt has nothing,\u201d Gultom said, \u201cto do with us.\u201d\nHarita, which debuted on the Jakarta stock exchange in April, plans to add a second processing plant on Obira next year, company executives said."\n\n(Indoprogress, 1/14/2023, indoprogress.com): Details unfair land compensation case of Lily Mangudap, environmental degradation and pollution of water sources, increased resident health problems, lack of access to electricity, forced relocation\n\n(Mongabay, 12/9/2022,ww.mongabay.co.id/2022/12/09/): Surrounded by Nickel Industry, Kawasi Residents Face Environmental Problems, Protest Village Relocation\n-  "The community consisting of religious leaders, traditional leaders, village government and cross-organizations approached the South Halmahera DPRD, questioning the news about the Kawasi Village relocation plan after the nickel mining company, PT Harita Group, began operating on Obi Island.

                                    'Dispute with local residents, Environmental Impact:\nLocal resident protests of environmental damage from Antam mining in the area dating back to 2006.\n\n(Ekuatorial, 7/23/2021, ekuatorial.com/en/2021/07/): "Anas is trying to prove that the mud he is walking on is the result of years of sedimentation build-up from waste released by PT Aneka Tambang (Antam). The state-owned mining company that has been reaping annual net profit of around Rp1.15 trillion, has also been dumping waste from its nickel mining operations high up on the hill, to the coast.\nThe waste released by the company that has been operating there since 2006, has now covered and polluted the bottom of the coastal area. Anas says that the place where he is now standing, was once teeming with corals, a habitat for fishes and other marine life.\nHis father, who was a fisherman from Sulawesi and moved to the area under the government\u2019s sponsored transmigration program in the 1980s, often recounted that there used to be so many fishermen working in Moronopo Bay but now no more.\n\u201cThe mackerels which are commonly consumed by people were a staple. But now their habitat has been destroyed,\u201d Anas said during an interview in mid-May.\nThe Moronopo Bay is administratively located in Soasangaji village, in the Kota Maba sub-district of East Halmahera, North Maluku. It takes five hours to reach the area from Sofifi, the main town in North Maluku.\nThe East Halmahera Environment Agency has noted that the waste sedimentation had covered an area of four hectares. At the farthest point from the coastline, about 100 meters from the source of the waste disposal, the waste layer, consisting of mud and rock, rises up to almost one meter from the beach surface.\nThe company tried to cover the waste by planting mangroves but Anas said it was a failed attempt as the waste continued to flow into the bay and the mangrove could not survive, in contrast to the naturally grown mangroves in the area.\nIn one corner where mangrove seedlings had just been planted, a board that says \u201cPT Antam Mangrove Planting Conservation\u201d sticks out from the ground. The board also indicates the first mangrove was planted in 2009.\n\u201cSo, these mangroves were planted in hopes to reduce the impacts of the waste pollution and it has been done several times, but they are still a far cry from the massive scale of their mining activities,\u201d Anas said.\nThe worsening condition of the Moronopo bay is what prompted local residents to hold a protest on April 7, 2021, demanding that Antam cease all its mining activities. There was no response from the company.\nThe nickel mining operation on top of the hill in the Moronopo Bay area, is part of a mining concession owned by Antam and will expire in 2040. The concession of some 39,000 hectares, or more than half of the surface of the nation\u2019s capital, Jakarta, straddled two subdistricts \u2013 Maba and Kota Maga.\nAntam is also mining nickel in Tanjung Buli, Maba subdistrict, since 2001; and in Pakal Island, in Kota Maba subdistrict, since 2011.\nIn 1998, Antam started mining nickel in Gee Island, Maba. The island has entered rehabilitation phase, although remnants of exploitation of the area remain evident.\nIn 2012, Antam also built a nickel refinery in Tanjung Buli but this facility is not yet in operation, while the permit will expire in 2032.\nThe company that was established not long after the establishment of the New Order, has been exploiting mineral in these two subdistricts of East Halmahera for more than two decades."\n\n(Tandaseru, 4/7/2021, tandaseru.com ): 2 Meters of Mud on the Shoreline, East Halmahera Residents Demonstrate Antam\n"A number of residents of East Halmahera Regency , North Maluku Province, staged an action at the Moronopo mining site owned by PT Aneka Tambang, Wednesday (7/4).\nThis is because local residents think that Antam is not serious about handling mining waste which has caused the nearby coast to be filled with 2 meters of mud.\nThis action was led by Kapita Sangaji Maba Haltim, Ibrahim Haruna. This action was triggered by public unrest who accused Antam of polluting the environment with its mining waste.\n"Because this mining location has practically been active for years, but until now in handling environmental pollution there has been no seriousness from Antam itself," said Udin, one of the demonstrators.\nThe demonstrators also demanded that mining activities in Moronopo be stopped before fixing environmental pollution at that location.\n\u201cEnvironmental problems in Moronopo have been going on for decades. So we, the people who attended, hoped that this would not be considered a trivial matter, because when we dived on the beach the mud was more than 2 meters. It means that this mining location has to be moved, bearing in mind that PT Antam\'s mining area is large," continued Udin.\nMeanwhile, Kapita Sangaji, Ibrahim Haruna, in front of members of the East Halmahera DPRD and the company, who at that time also immediately checked the location, said that seeing the waste at the Moronopo mining site which had not been handled so far, the government and DPRD were expected to take steps to deal with the waste that had have piled up on the beach.\n"So the government and DPRD are trying to pay attention to this waste, because this is a matter of the needs of the people of Haltim," he said.\nThe demonstrators also promised to continue to oversee the process of improving environmental pollution. If PT Antam does not take this matter seriously, a boycott will be carried out at the mining site."',
